Intro (2014 Forest Hills Drive) Lyrics[Produced by J. Cole]
[Directed by Scott Lazer]

[Refrain]
Do you wanna, do you wanna be?
Do you wanna, do you wanna be?
Do you wanna, do you wanna be, free?
Do you wanna, do you wanna be, happy?
Do you wanna, do you wanna be, happy?
Do you wanna be, happy?
Do you wanna, do you wanna be, happy?
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be, happy?
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be, free?
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be happy?
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be, free?
[Verse]
Free from pain, free from scars
Free to sing, free from bars
Free my dawgs, you're free to go
Block is hot, the streets is cold
Free to love, to each his own
Free from bills, free from pills
You roll it loud, the speakers blow
Life get hard, you ease your soul
It cleanse ya mind, learn to fly
Then reach the stars, you take the time
To look behind and say, "Look where I came
Look how far I done came"
They say that dreams come true
And when they do, that there's a beautiful thing

[Refrain]
Now do you wanna, do you wanna be happy?
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be free?
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be?84Embed January 28th Lyrics[Produced by J. Cole & Team Titans]
[Intro]
Rap tune
Can I make a million dollars off a rap tune?
Can I make a million dollars off a rap tune?
I'm tryna make a million dollars off a rap tune
Yeah, look

[Verse 1]
The real is back, the ville is back
Flow bananas, here, peel this back
And what you'll find is, your highness
Can paint a picture that is vivid enough to cure blindness
Carolina's finest, you knew that already
In terms of the greatest, I proved that already
And if you would like, I do it twice
I just sharpen my blade, for a minute became lost in my ways
This for my niggas that was tossed in the graves
Every so often I fade deep in my thoughts
And then get lost in the days
We used to play before your coffin was made
Just got the call nigga got caught with a stray
Hope he's okay
Just got paid what Cochran got paid to free OJ
Just to share my life on the stage in front of strangers
Who know a nigga far too well, and that's the danger
Know me better than I know myself
I rip a page out my notebook in anger
And let these thoughts linger, singing
[Chorus]
Don't give 'em too much you (Don't give 'em too much you)
Don't let 'em take control (Don't let 'em take control)
It's one thing you do (It's one thing you do)
Don't let 'em taint your soul (Don't let 'em taint your soul)
If you believe in God (If you believe in God)
One thing's for sure (One thing's for sure)
If you ain't aim too high (If you ain't aim too high)
Then you aim too low (Then you aim too low)

[Verse 2]
What's the price for a black man life?
I check the toe tag, not one zero in sight
I turn the TV on, not one hero in sight
Unless he dribble or he fiddle with mics
Look out the window 'cause tonight the city lit up with lights
Cameras and action
May no man alive come through and damage my faction
I brought you niggas with me 'cause I  love you like my brothers
And your mothers' like my mother
Think we need a plan of action
The bigger we get the more likely egos collide, it's just physics
Please let's put our egos aside, you my niggas
And should our worst tendencies turn us into enemies
I hope that we remember these
Nights full of Hennessy
When Hov around we switch up to that D'usse
Gotta show respect, one day we tryna stay where you stay
'Cause we from where you from
Not talkin' bout the slums
I'm talkin' 'bout that mind state that keep a black nigga dumb
Keep a black nigga dyin' by a black nigga gun
And keep on listening to the frontin' ass rap niggas son
Yeah I said 'son'
This is New York's finest
For 11 winters straight I took on New York's climate
Like show me New York's ladder
I climb it and set the bar so high that you gotta get Obama to force the air force to find it
Never mind it, you'll never reach that
Cole is the hypnotist, control the game whenever he snap
That's every track, nigga
[Chorus]
Don't give 'em too much you (Don't give 'em too much you)
Don't let 'em take control (Don't let 'em take control)
It's one thing you do (It's one thing you do)
Don't let 'em taint your soul (Don't let 'em taint your soul)
If you believe in God (If you believe in God)
One thing's for sure (One thing's for sure)
If you ain't aim too high (If you ain't aim too high)
Then you aim too low (Then you aim too low)

[Verse 3]
I ain't serve no pies, I ain't slang no dope
I don't bring no lies, niggas sang my quotes
I don't play no games, boy I ain't no joke
Like the great Rakim, when I make my notes
You niggas might be L or you might be Kane
Or you might be Slick Rick with 19 chains
Or you might be Drizzy Drake or Kendrick Lamar
But check your birth date nigga, you ain't the god
Nah you ain't the god
Nigga, Cole the god (Cole the god, Cole the god)

[Outro]
Make a million dollars off a rap tune
Can I make a million dollars off a rap tune?
(*sound of baby laughing*)
I'm tryna make a million dollars off a rap tune
I wanna make a million dollars off a rap tune
I'm gonna make a million dollars off a rap tune260Embed Wet Dreamz Lyrics[Intro]
Cole
Cole world
Yeah
Let me take y'all back, man
As I do so well
Wadn't nuttin' like that
Man, it wadn't nuttin' like that

[Verse 1]
First time, she was in my math class (Uh-huh)
Long hair, brown skin with the fat ass
Sat beside me, used to laugh, had mad jokes
The teacher always got mad, so we passed notes
It started off so innocent
She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it, uh
I was a youngin, straight crushin', tryna play the shit cool
But a nigga couldn't wait to get to school, ‘cause when I seen
Them thighs on her and them hips on her and them lips on her
Got me daydreamin', man, what
I'm thinkin' how she rides on it, if she sits on it, if she licks on it
Make it hard for me to stand up, as time goes by
Attractions gettin' deep and
Wet dreamin', thinkin' that I'm smashin' but I'm sleepin', I want it bad
And I ain't never been obsessed before
She wrote a note that said, "You ever had sex before?" Damn…
[Chorus]
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

[Verse 2]
I wrote back and said
"Of course I had sex before," knowin' I was frontin'
I said, "I'm like a pro, baby," knowin' I was stuntin'
But if I told the truth, I knew that I'd get played out, son
Hadn't been in pussy since the day I came out one, but
She don't know that, so she done wrote back and told me
"Oh, you a pro, homie? Well, I want you to show me
My mama gone for the weekend
So Saturday, baby, we can get to freakin'."
That's when my heart start racin' and my body start sweatin'
Baby, you done woke my lil' man up
I'm thinkin' how that body look naked when you layin' on the bed
Teacher, please, don't make me stand up, I wrote back like
"Yeah, baby, sound like a plan."
Still tryna play it cool, sound like the man
But I was scared to death, my nigga, my stomach turnin'
Talkin' shit, knowin' damn well I was a virgin, fuck
[Chorus]
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

[Verse 3]
Yeah, you know that feelin' when you
Know you finna bone for the first time?
I'm hopin' that she won't notice it's my first time
I'm hopin' that my shit is big enough to fuck wit'
And most of all I'm prayin', "God, don't let me bust quick"
I'm watchin' pornos, tryna see just how to stroke right
Practice puttin' condoms on—how it go? Right
I'm in her crib, now a nigga palm sweatin'
With a pocket full of rubbers and an erection
That's when my hands start touchin' and her face start blushin'
And a nigga roll over on top and then she
Get my pants unbuckled and her hands start rubbin'
On me, ooh girl, don't stop, it's time for action
Pull out the condoms real smooth, yeah, just how I practiced
But right before I put it in, she flinched and grabbed it and said
"I wanna get somethin' off my mental
I can tell you're a pro, but baby, be gentle, ‘cause—"
[Chorus]
‘Cause I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

[Verse 1]
I grew up, a fucking screw up, tie my shoe up
Wish they was newer, damn, need something newer
In love with the baddest girl in the city, I wish I knew her
I wish I wasn't so shy, I wish I was a bit more fly
I wish that I could tell her how I really feel inside
That I'm the perfect nigga for her, but then maybe that's a lie
She like a certain type of nigga, and it's clear I'm not that guy
Ball player, star player, I'm just watchin' from the side
On the bench, 'cause my lack of confidence won't let me fly
I ain't grow up with my father, I ain't thinkin' 'bout that now
Fast forward four years or so from now, I'll probably cry
When I realize what I missed, but as of now my eyes are dry
'Cause I'm tryna stay alive, in the city where too many niggas die
Dreamin' quiet trying to dodge a suit and tie
Who am I? (La la la)
Ayy, who am I? (La la la la la, yeah)
[Chorus]
Things change, rearrange and so do I
It ain't always for the better, dawg, I can't lie
I get high 'cause the lows can be so cold
I might bend a little bit but I don't fold
One time for my mind and two for yours
I got food for your thoughts to soothe your soul
If you see my tears fall, just let me be
Move along, nothing to see

[Verse 2]
I always did shit the hard way
My nigga [inaudible] slangin' in the hallway
Burnt CD's and trees like this was Broadway
Times Square, kept the dimes there in the locker
Some Reggie Miller with more brown hairs than Chewbacca
Whispers that he got it for the low-low, sell a
Dime for a dub, them white boys ain't know no better
Besides, what's twenty dollars to a nigga like that?
He tell his pops he need some lunch and he gon' get it right back
I peeped game, got home snatched my mama keychain
Took her whip, the appeal, too ill to refrain
I hit the boulevard, pull up to my nigga front do'
His mama at home, she still let 'em hit the blunt though
I told her, "Hello", and sat with my nigga and laughed
And talked about how we gon' smash all the bitches in class
I complimented how I see him out here getting his cash
And just asked, "What a nigga gotta do to get that?
Put me on," he just laughed when he seen I was sure
17 years breathing, his demeanor said more
He told me, "Nigga, you know how you sound right now?
If you wasn't my mans, I would think that you a clown right now
Listen, you everything I wanna be, that's why I fucks with you
So how you looking up to me when I look up to you?
You 'bout to go get a degree, I'ma be stuck with two choices:
Either graduate to weight or selling number two
For what? A hundred bucks or two a week?
Do you think that you would know what to do if you was me?
I got, four brothers, one mother that don't love us
If they ain't want us, why the fuck they never wore rubbers?"
I felt ashamed to have ever complained
About my lack of gear and thought about how far we done came
From trailer park to a front yard with trees in the sky
Thank you mama, dry your eyes, there ain't no reason to cry
You made a genius and I, ain't gon' take it for granted
I ain't gon' settle for lesser, I ain't gon' take what they handed
Nah, I'm gon' take what they owe me and show you that I can fly
And show old girl what she missing, the illest nigga alive
Ayy, who am I?
[Chorus]
Things change, rearrange and so do I (Ayy, who am I?)
It ain't always for the better, dawg, I can't lie (Who am I?)
I get high 'cause the lows can be so cold
I might bend a little bit but I don't fold
One time for my mind and two for yours
I got food for your thoughts to soothe your soul
If you see my tears fall, just let me be
Move along, nothing to see

[Intro]
Uh

[Verse 1]
Since a youngin' always dreamed of gettin' rich
Look at me, my nigga
Fantasize about a white picket fence
With some trees, my nigga
Used to want a Pathfinder with some tints
That's all I need, my nigga
Throw some 20's on that bitch and get it rinsed
But now I see, my nigga
That the world's a lot bigger ever since
Picked up the paper
And they say my nigga Eddie caught a body, I'm convinced
Anybody is a killer, all you gotta do is push 'em to the limits
Fuck being timid in the Civic
Politicin' with the pushers and the pimps
I'm tryna write a story, can I get a glimpse?
Yeah, can I get a glimpse?
[Chorus 1]
Last night I had a bad dream (Bad dream, bad dream)
That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing? (Bad thing, bad thing)
They robbin' niggas on the daily
Can you blame a nigga that ain't never had things?
(What's the value of a thing?) Guess not
Last night they pulled up on my nigga at the light like—
Ugh, nice watch, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air
Hands in the air now, hands in the air

[Bridge]
Small town nigga, Hollywood dreams
I know that everything that glitters ain't gold
I know the shit ain't always good as it seems
But tell me 'til you get it how could you know?
How could you know? (How could you know? How could you know? How could you know? How could you know? How could you know?)
How could you know? (How could you know? How could you know? How could you know? How could you know? How could you know?)
[Verse 2]
Listen up, I'm 'bout to go and get rich
Fuck with me, my nigga
We gon' circle 'round the Ville and hit a lick
Cop some trees, my nigga
And some powder, bag it up and make it flip
You gon' see, my nigga
One day we gon' graduate and cop a brick
And that's the key, my nigga
Listen up, I'm 'bout to go and get rich
Stand back and watch if you want to, nigga
Me, I want my pockets fat, a badder bitch
Tired of seein' niggas flaunt, I wanna flaunt too, nigga
Watch some rollers in a fuckin' Crown Vic
Tryna lock a nigga up, that's what they won't do, nigga
Wanna know a funny thing about this shit?
Even if you let 'em kill your dream
It'll haunt you, nigga, haunt you
[Chorus 2]
Last night I had a bad dream
That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?
I look around like—
Do you wanna be another nigga, that ain't never had things? (What's the value of a thing?)
Guess not
Last night we pulled up on a nigga at the light like
(You know what the fuck it is, nigga, run that shit right now)
Uh, nice watch, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air
Hands in the air now, hands in the air

[Outro]
Father forgive me for my childish ways
I look outside and all the clouds are gray
I need your hands to take me miles away
Your wish is my command, my command, my command
But before you go I've got to warn you now
Whatever goes up surely must come down
And you'll get your piece, but know peace won't be found
So why just take me man, take me man, take me man
Your wish is my command, my command, my command374Embed Fire Squad Lyrics[Produced by J. Cole & Vinylz]

[Chorus]
Nigga why you actin' like a ho?
Know that I'ma ride for ya, either way it go
Tell me, girl why you be stressin' me for time?
When you tell me you love me, can't you see I'm tryna climb?
Damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch?
If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?
Come here baby why you always insecure?
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure
[Verse 1]
Ain't a way around it no more, I am the greatest
A lotta niggas sat on the throne, I am the latest
I am the bravest, go toe to toe with the giants
I ain't afraid of you niggas, I'll end up fading you niggas
'Fore it's all said and done, this nigga need medicine
My uzi, it weighed a ton, I need me a better gun
In fact I just might need two, cause niggas say they the one
And I got something to prove
Forgive me, Lord, here they come, BLAOOW

[Chorus]
Nigga why you actin' like a ho?
Know that I'ma ride for ya, either way it go
Tell me, girl why you be stressin' me for time?
When you tell me you love me, can't you see I'm tryna climb?
Damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch?
If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?
Come here baby why you always insecure?
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure

[Verse 2]
My inhibition's fighting my intuition
Premature premonition, showing me the demolition
Of these phony niggas, so ahead of my time
Even when I rhyme about the future I be reminiscing
You want the truth well come and listen
I'm like that time you bagged a dime and checked ya phone and saw it was a number missing
As fate passes you by, half of you try
The other half of you fried, too high to actually fly
One day y'all have to decide, who you gon' be
A scary nigga or a nigga that's gon' rule like me
Keep it true like me, Cole you might be
Like the new Ice Cube, meets the new Ice-T
Meets 2 Live Crew, meets the new Spike Lee
Meets Bruce like Wayne, meets Bruce like Lee
Meets '02 Lil Wayne, in a new white tee
Meets KD, ain't no nigga that can shoot like me!
BLAOOOW!
[Chorus]
Nigga why you actin' like a ho?
Know that I'ma ride for ya, either way it go
Tell me, girl why you be stressin' me for time?
When you tell me you love me, can't you see I'm tryna climb?
Damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch?
If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?
Come here baby why you always insecure?
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure

[Bridge]
(Who's the king?)
Came from the bottom nigga, with stains on my shirt
What you expected from me, I came from the dirt
(Who's the king?)
Money my motivator, the songs that I sing
Picture a peasant passin' from pawn to a king
(Who's the king?)
You tell me ya still love me, if so then let me go
Will I return or will I burn, never know
(Who's the king?)
Look in my eyes and see the future
But don't sugar coat it
[Verse 3]
Listen...
History repeats itself and that's just how it goes
Same way that these rappers always bite each other's flows
Same thing that my nigga Elvis did with Rock 'n Roll
Justin Timberlake, Eminem and then Macklemore
While silly niggas argue over who gon' snatch the crown
Look around, my nigga, white people have snatched the sound
This year I'll prolly go to the awards dappered down
Watch Iggy win a Grammy as I try to crack a smile
I'm just playin', but all good jokes contain true shit
Same rope you climb up on, they'll hang you with
But not Jermaine, my aim too sick
I bang nigga, I came to bring the pain my brain too quick
You see how I maneuver this game, I ain't stupid
I recognize that life is a dream, and I dream lucid
And break the chains and change minds
One verse at a time, and claim 2-6
And fuck it, if the shoe fits, who's the king?
[Outro]
We all kings
(We all kings nigga)
Kings of ourselves first and foremost
(True)
While the people debate who's the king of this rap game
Here comes lil' ol' Jermaine
With every ounce of strength in his veins
To snatch the crown from whoever y'all think has it
But rather than place it on his head as soon as he grabs it
Poof, boom, paow, it's like magic
With a flash and a BANG the crown disintegrates
And falls to the Earth from which it came
It's done
Ain't gonna be no more kings
Be wary of any man that claims
Because deep down he clings onto the need for power
In reality he's a coward
Ultimately he's scared to die
And sometimes so am I
But when I'm in tune with the most high
I realize, the fear lies in my lack of awareness of the other side
Today I know that we are the same, are the same, you and I
Different kind of skin, different set of eyes
Two different minds, but only one God
(It's only one God nigga)
It's for all the kings
'Cause I know deep down every poet just wanna be loved743Embed St. Tropez Lyrics[Produced by J. Cole]

[Verse 1: J. Cole & TS, J Cole]
Roll up and smoke my sins away
I'd like to go to St. Tropez
Maybe I'll go, maybe I'll stay (Maybe I'll stay)
She asked me if I'm scared to fly
To tell the truth, I'm terrified
I never been that high before
Very bad reason not to go
Terrible reason not to go

Ayy, from the door I showed you my scars
And I told you girl, "I won't lie-ie-ie"
If we at war, then this is a war
That I can't afford, no I, I, I
I wanted more but that was before
Lord knows I'm torn, so I–I cry (No I, I, I)
From the corner of my eye, baby
It's been hard for me to smile-ile
Lately, it's been hard for me to smile-ile
Lately, it's been hard for me to smile-ile

They tryna say I can't come back, ayy, let me tell you 'bout it
Man, fuck them niggas, I come back, ayy, let me tell you 'bout it
I wanna tell you 'bout it: hands up, everybody run

Eat the cake bitch, eat the damn cake, uh

Young nigga never had love
You know, foot massage, back rub shit
Blowin' bubbles in the bathtub shit
That is until I met you
Together we done watch years go by
Seen a river of your tears go by
Got me thinkin' 'bout some kids, still I
Tell them hoes come through, the break up
Get to know somebody and you really learn a lot about 'em
Won’t be long before you start to doubt 'em
Tell yourself you better off without 'em
Then in time you will find can't walk without 'em
Can't talk without 'em, can't breathe without 'em
Came here together, you can't leave without 'em
So you walk back in, make a scene about 'em
On your Amerie, it's just 1 Thing about 'em
It's called love, niggas don't sing about it no more
Don't nobody sing about it no more, no more
It's called love, niggas don't sing about it no more

Why every rich black nigga gotta be famous?
Why every broke black nigga gotta be brainless?
Uh, that's a stereotype
Driven by some people up in Aerial Heights
Here's a scenario:
Young Cole pockets is fat like Lil Terrio
Dreamville, give us a year we'll be on every show
Yeah, fuck nigga, I'm very sure, heh
Fuck the rest, I'm the best nigga out
When I'm back home, I'm the best in the South
When I'm in L.A., I'm the best in the West
You contest? You can test, I'ma stretch niggas out
Ooh, I'ma stretch niggas out
That go for all y'all if I left niggas out
This shit for everybody on my testicles
Please make sure you put the rest in your mouth, ho519Embed No Role Modelz Lyrics[Verse 1]
First things first: rest in peace, Uncle Phil
For real
You the only father that I ever knew
I get my bitch pregnant, I'ma be a better you
Prophecies that I made way back in the Ville
Fulfilled
Listen, even back when we was broke, my team ill
Martin Luther King woulda been on Dreamville, talk to a nigga

[Pre-Chorus]
One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. ho
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know
[Chorus]
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

[Verse 2]
No role models, and I'm here right now
No role models to speak of
Searchin' through my memory, my memory, I couldn't find one
Last night, I was gettin' my feet rubbed by the baddest bitch
Not Trina, but I swear to God, this bitch'll make you call your girl up
And tell her, "Hey, what's good?
Sorry, I'm never comin' home, I'ma stay for good"
Then hang the phone up and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame 'bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich 'cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said, "Nah, I was the same without it"
But then I thought back, back to a better me
Before I was a B-list celebrity
'Fore I started callin' bitches "bitches" so heavily
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody, you wadn't sweatin' me

[Pre-Chorus]
One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. ho
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know
[Chorus]
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

[Verse 3]
I want a real love, dark-skinned Aunt Viv love
That Jada and that Will love
That leave a toothbrush at your crib love
And you ain't gotta wonder whether that's your kid love
Nigga, I don't want no bitch from reality shows
Out-of-touch-with-reality hoes
Out in Hollywood bringin' back five or six hoes
Fuck 'em then we kick 'em to the do', nigga, you know how it go
She deserved that, she a bird, it's a bird trap
You think if I didn't rap she would flirt back?
Takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt, 'fore she leave
"I'ma need my shirt back" (Nigga, you know how it go)

[Pre-Chorus]
One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. ho
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know
[Chorus]
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

There's an old saying in Tennessee—I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee—that says, fool me once... shame on... shame on you
Fool me—can't get fooled again

[Bridge]
Fool me one time, shame on you (Ayy)
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you (Ayy)
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you (Bop, bop, bop)
Fool me one time, shame on you (Ayy)
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you (Ayy)
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you (Bop, bop, bop)

[Verse 4]
My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet
My only regret was too young for Nia Long
Now all I'm left with is hoes from reality shows
Hand her a script, the bitch prolly couldn't read along
My only regret was too young for Sade Adu
My only regret, could never take Aaliyah home
Now all I'm left with is hoes up in Greystone
With the stale face 'cause they know it's they song

[Pre-Chorus]
She shallow but the pussy deep (She shallow
She shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (She shallow), yeah, ayy

She shallow but the pussy deep (She shallow), haha

She shallow but the pussy deep (She shallow

[Chorus]
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

Hello, hello, hello

[Verse 1]
And I thought about you today
And I thought about the things you used to say
And I thought about the things we did
And I thought about your newest kid
And damn that makes two now
Oh what do I do now?
'Cause if we ever got together
I'd have to be them niggas step-pops forever
And well that ain't my thing 'cause I
I ain't even got my own
And I ain't really got no home
No place to put these things I own
And I thought about the things you used to say
And I thought about the games you used to play
And I thought about that little kid
And I thought about the things we did
I always thought that we would be together
I always knew that we would be together
But I don't wanna wait forever
I don't wanna wait forever

Everything's so sad when you look back

[Verse 2]
On the rebound like a book back
On the rebound like a put back
Don't just sit back, bitch get on it
Time fly by way too quick, don't it?
Reflection bring regrets don't it?
Rejection makes you defensive
So you protect your pride with your reflexes
But life is a game with no reset on the end
[Bridge 2]
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no

I got my wings to carry me

I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask the Lord to follow me
I've been unfaithful

[Verse 1]
This is my canvas (Yeah, my canvas)
I'ma paint it how I want it baby, oh I
This is my canvas
I'ma paint it, paint it, paint it, how I want it nigga
Fuck you 'cause there, there is no right or wrong, only a song
I like to write alone, be in my zone
Think back to Forest Hills, no perfect home
But the only thing like home I've ever known
Until they snatched it from my mama
And foreclosed her on the loan
I'm so sorry that I left you there to deal with that alone
I was up in New York City chasing panties, getting dome
Had no clue what you was going through
How could you be so strong?
And how could I be so selfish? I know I can be so selfish
I could tell by how I treat you with my girl, damn she so selfless
But she put up with my ways because she loves me like you do
And though it don't always show, I love her just like I love you, and
I need to treat you better
Wish you could live forever
So we could spend more time together
I love you mama

I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me

Another day, another rhyme, ho
Another day, another time zone
Today, I woke up feeling horny so it's only right, I got two bitches playing on my trombone
Keep up, never sure where the words would take me
Niggas eat em up and regurgitate me
Shit trump tight never slurred it lazy
Give a virgin the urge to rape me, nigga please
Best friends really make great for enemies
My watch came, niggas can't wait for one of these
I see you, nigga, this ain't no Rolex, it's an AP, nigga
I'm hot, dog, catch up to me, nigga— huh, couldn't resist
Aim for the stars and I shouldn't have missed
But I was riding on fumes, so I stopped by the moon
Now I'm sitting on the hood of this bitch
Like, "Thanks for the view," waiting on thanks from a few
'Cause without me you wouldn't exist
You know that shit, gave you the blueprint, don't forget
Cole is your phone on zero percent
Going off, now niggas showing off
Niggas swear they hard, but they flowing soft
I'm taking off like "boing!" on a big ass Boeing, and getting head like a coin toss, too easy
[Chorus]
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask the Lord to follow me
I've been unfaithful
I don't know why you call on me

Heart beatin' fast, let a nigga know that he alive

Don't be sleepin' on your level
'Cause it's beauty in the struggle, nigga (Beauty, beauty)
Goes for all y'all
It's beauty in the struggle, nigga (Beauty, beauty)
Let me explain, yeah

[Verse 1]
It's beauty in the struggle, ugliness in the success
Hear my words and listen to my signal of distress
I grew up in the city and know sometimes we had less
Compared to some my niggas down the block, man, we were blessed
And life can't be no fairy tale, no once upon a time
But I be goddamned if a nigga don't be tryin'
So tell me, Momma please, why you be drinkin' all the time?
Does all the pain he brought you still linger in your mind?
'Cause pain still lingers on mine
On the road to riches, listen, this is what you'll find
The good news is, nigga, you came a long way
The bad news is, nigga, you went the wrong way
Think being broke was better

No such thing as a life that's better than yours (Ha)

For what's money without happiness?
Or hard times without the people you love?
Though I'm not sure what's 'bout to happen next
I ask for strength from the Lord (Man) up above
'Cause I been strong so far, but I can feel my grip loosenin'
Quick, do somethin' before you lose it for good, get it back and use it for good
And touch the people how you did like before
I'm tired of livin' with demons 'cause they always invitin' more
Think being broke was better, now I don't mean that phrase with no disrespect
To all my niggas out there livin' in debt
Cashin' minimal checks, turn on the TV, see a nigga Rolex
And fantasize about a life with no stress
I mean this shit sincerely, and as a nigga who was once in your shoes
Livin' with nothin' to lose, I hope one day you hear me
Always gon' be a bigger house somewhere, but nigga feel me
Long as the people in that motherfucker love you dearly
Always gon' be a whip that's better than the one you got
Always gon' be some clothes that's fresher than the ones you rock
Always gon' be a bitch that's badder out there on the tours
But you ain't never gon' be happy 'til you love yours

No such thing as a life that's better than yours (Love yours)
No such thing as a life that's better than yours (Love yours)
No such thing as a life that's better than yours (Love yours)

The bells getting loud, ain't nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to go, put away my pride
Tired of feeling low even when I'm high
Ain't no way to live, do I wanna die?
I don't know, I don't know
Bells getting loud, ain't nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to go, put away my pride
Tired of feeling low even when I'm high
Ain't no way to live, do I wanna die?
I don't know, I don't know

Awwwww...haha

[Verse 1]
Now I was barely seventeen with a pocket full of hope
Screamin' "dollar and a dream" with my closet lookin' broke
And my nigga's lookin' clean, gettin' caught up with that dope
Have you ever served a fiend with a pocket full of soap?
Nigga I can tell you things that you probably shouldn't know
Have you ever heard the screams when the body hit the floor?
Flashbacks to the pain, wakin' up, cold sweats
Six o'clock in the mornin', gotta hit the BowFlex
Get my weight up on the block, keep watch for the cops
God they love to serve a nigga three hots and a cot
Nowadays crime pays like a part time job
And the drought got me prayin' for a Carl Thom vibe
Summer Rain come again
Numb the pain 'cause it's hard for a felon
In my mind I been cryin', know it's wrong but I'm sellin'
Eyes wellin' up with tears
Thinkin' 'bout my niggas dead in the dirt
Immortalized on this shirt
[Chorus]
Real niggas don't die
Forward with the plot
One-Seven-Forty-Five
Form at the plot
Real niggas don't die
Form on the block
Real niggas don't lie
Form in the plot
My niggas don't die
Form on the block
Real niggas don't die
Form on the block
Real niggas don't die
Real niggas don't die

[Verse 2]
Have you ever seen a fiend cook crack on the spoon?
Have you ever seen a nigga that was black on the moon?
Have you ever seen your brother go to prison as you cry?
Have you ever seen a motherfuckin' ribbon in the sky?
Nope, all I see is that C.R.E.A.M nigga, that green
I'm a black king, black jeans on my black queen
And her ass fat, too fat for a flat screen
I'm the type of nigga make the whole fuckin' trap lean
Kingpin nigga, put wings on a crack fiend
If they want a nigga, they gon' have to send a SWAT team
And I'm goin' out like Scarface in his last scene
A legend, what that mean—?
[Chorus]
Real niggas don't die
Forward with the plot

[Outro]
To die a young legend or live a long life unfulfilled
'Cause you wanna change the world, but while alive you never will
'Cause they only feel you after you gone, or I've been told
And now I'm caught between bein' heard and gettin' old
Damn, death creepin' in my thoughts lately
My one wish in this bitch, "Make it quick if the Lord take me"
I know nobody meant to live forever anyway
And so I hustle like my niggas in Virgini-A
They tellin' niggas, "sell dope, rap or go to NBA"
In that order, it's that sort of thinkin'
That been keepin' niggas chained at the bottom and hanged
The strangest fruit that you ever seen, ripe with pain, listen...108Embed Deja Vu Lyrics[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Sometimes you worry 'bout the things he can provide for ya
Whenever you around I seem to come alive for ya
I finally recognize the feelings that's inside for ya
Although I know your man and trust me he would die for ya
These quiet thoughts of you been going on for years now
I saw you in the party, soft lips, soft-spoken
I came and talked to you but homie interfered now
He introduced you as his girl and I was heartbroken
Some people talk about that love at first sight shit
To keep it real I don't know whether I believe it's true
But if it is then tell me if I'm wrong or right if
I fell in love with you before I ever even knew
I catch your eye then look away as if it never happened
At times I feel as though I'm caught up in a strange dream
If eyes could talk then mines would tell ya that I'm feeling you
Sometimes I swear your eyes be telling me the same thing

Club jumping, don't stop, off top
But you know we only go 'til 2 o'clock
Put yo motherfuckin' hood up, it's the weekend
Drop that, back that ass up and bitches get to freaking
Last call at the bar, ladies get a drink, nigga get some balls
Ain't no telling you gonna see that bitch tomorrow
Stop holding up the wall waiting for the right song
Better holla 'cause you know they 'bout to cut the lights on

[Verse 2]
And put my number in it—
I'm staring at you from afar
I'm wondering 'bout you, like where you from and who you are
'Cause you a star, no, not the type that snort the white lines
I mean the type that light the night time, I heard you got a man
But who in their right mind letting you out the house alone?
Tell me is your house a home?
Why you in the club looking like you out to zone?
Now be discreet and pull out your phone and put my number in it
Text a nigga when your man leave you unattended
On a scale from 1 to 10 that girl's a hundred and I want it
No question, I know destiny well
And though I sin the Lord blessing me still
Every saint got a past, every sinner got a future
Every loser gotta win and every winner gotta lose someday
They say it's just a matter of time
And if I had my way then you would be mine, huh

Trials and tribulations I'm facing
In this age of information, I hate this shit
Cause niggas hit my phone when they want some shit
Bitches hit my phone when they want some dick
Damn it, won't be long 'fore I disappear
Damn it, won't be long 'fore I disappear
Damn it, won't be long 'fore I disappear

Similar to my niggas duckin' cases
Can't take the possible time that he faces

My dad, he died—he got shot 'cause his friend set him up. And I didn't go to his funeral—and sometimes when I'm in my room, I get mad at my momma when she mean to me. And she—

Catch me, don't you catch me

I wanna cry
And I ain't even tryna fight it

'Cause now you're here and I just wanna be
Right by your side
On any night that you be crying, baby
I'll dry your eyes

Every time you go to sleep you look like you in Heaven
Plus the head game is stronger than a few Excedrin
You shine just like the patent leather on my new 11's
You read me like a book like I'm the Bible, you the Reverend
Yeah, I wanna tell the truth to you
I wanna talk about my days as a youth to you
Exposing you to all my demons and the reasons I'm this way
I would like to paint a picture, but it'll take more than a day
It would take more than some years to get all over all my fears
Preventing me from letting you see all of me perfectly clear
The same wall that's stopping me from letting go and shedding tears
From the lack of having father, and the passing of my peers
While I'm too scared to expose myself
It turns out, you know me better than I know myself
Better than I know myself
Well how 'bout that?

My intuition is telling me there'll be better days, yeah
My intuition is telling me there'll be better days
I like this tone

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, my intuition is telling me there'll be better days
I sit in silence and find whenever I meditate
My fears alleviate, my tears evaporate
My faith don't deviate, ideas don't have a date
But see I'm growing and getting stronger with every breath
Bringing me closer to Heaven's doors with every step
As we speak I'm at peace, no longer scared to die
Most niggas don't believe in God and so they terrified
It's either that or they be fearing they gon' go to Hell
Asking the Father for forgiveness, got 'em overwhelmed (Please, God, I want to go to Heaven)
As if He's spiteful like them white folks that control the jail
See I believe if God is real, He'd never judge a man
Because He knows us all and therefore He would understand
The ignorance that make a nigga take his brother life
The bitterness and pain that got him beating on his wife
[Chorus: J. Cole]
I know you desperate for a change let the pen glide
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from—
In cemeteries or in chains I see men cry
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from—

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Yeah, my chosen religion
Jesus piece frozen from sinnin'
Doin' dirt, hoping to God, He know my intentions
To see a million 'fore I see a casket
I got a baby on the way, know he gon' be a bastard
I'm living fast like I'm in a drag race, how that cash taste
When I was a senior, I was ballin' on my classmates
Niggas put three bullets in my car, one hit the gas tank
Know I got a angel cause I'm supposed to have a halo
Right now, my lifestyle destined for a federal facility
For my ability to make them birds fly
Fiends wanna get higher than a bird's eye view
And who am I to tell a nigga what to do?
I just supply, it's economics
My business ain't got the suit and tie
Keep a pistol at all times, niggas want what's mine
I can't oblige, dog, I work too hard
So reach for it, get referred to God, I'm going hard, nigga
[Chorus: J. Cole]
I know you desperate for a change let the pen glide
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from—
In cemeteries or in chains I see men cry
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from—

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Yeah, prodigal son, got a new gun
This one don't run out of ammo
Lately been working on my handles
Can I ball, become a star and remain my self?
If I fall, dust it off and regain my self
Fuck 'em all, they don't know all the pain I felt
I'm in awe, after all the fame I felt, I evolved
I no longer bury demons, I be a vessel for the truth until I'm barely breathing, I'm singing

[Bridge: Ari Lennox & J. Cole]
Life is all about the evolution
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
You can dream but don't neglect the execution
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
Time is short that's what somebody told me
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
Too short to keep following your homies
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
[Bridge: J. Cole]
I reminisce back to a time where niggas threw they hands
All of a sudden niggas pop a trunk and then we scram
Finger on trigger make a little nigga understand
What it's like to finally be the motherfuckin' man
Eyes wide that's from the power that the coward feels
Niggas die over bitches, disrespect, and dollar bills
Bloodshed that turned the city to a battlefield
I call it poison, you call it real (pop, pop, pop, pop)
That's how you feel?

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
Pistols be poppin' and niggas drop in a heartbeat
Scattered like roaches, a body laid on the concrete
A body laid on the concrete
Look, somebody laid on the concrete
No time for that, ain't no lookin' back, cause I'm running too
I made it home, I woke up and turned on the morning news
Overcame with a feeling I can't explain
Cause that was my nigga James that was slain, he was 22
(Last night at around...) He was 22
(22 year old black male, suspect, reporting live...)

[Outro: J. Cole]
(I swear to God, bruh)
We're gathered here today...
(I swear to God)
To mourn the life of James McMillan Jr
(I swear to God—nigga, I'ma kill them niggas, man)
A tragedy, another tragedy in the black community
(I promise you, bro...)
We got to do better, people
22 years old, this boy was too young
(I promise you, bro, I'ma kill them niggas, yo...)
Our condolences go to his family, our prayers
(I'ma kill them niggas myself...)
We know he's in a better place
We know he's in a better place
But this has got to end, ladies and gentleman
We've got to come together, this is—this is beyond words
Now I'd like to open this ceremony with a verse from—112Embed Neighbors Lyrics[Intro]
I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope,  sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I don't want no picture with the president
I just wanna talk to the man
Speak for the boys in the bando
And my nigga never walkin' again
'pologize if I'm harpin' again
I know these things happen often
But I'm back on the scene
I was lost in a dream
As I write this, the team down in Austin
I been buildin' me a house
Back home in the South, ma
Won't believe what it's costin'
And it's fit for a king, right?
Or a nigga that could sing
And explain all the pain that it cost him
My sixteen should've came with a coffin
Fuck the fame and the fortune
Well, maybe not the fortune
But one thing is for sure though
The fame is exhaustin'
That's why I moved away, I needed privacy
Surrounded by the trees and Ivy League
Students that's recruited highly
Thinkin' "You do you and I do me"
Crib has got a big 'ol back 'ol yard
My niggas stand outside and pass cigars
Filled with marijuana, laughin' hard
Thankful that they friend's a platinum star
In the driveway there's no rapper cars
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Welcome to the Sheltuh, this is pure
We'll help you if you've felt too insecure
To be the star you always knew you were
Wait, I think police is at the door
[Chorus]
Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
Hm, I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
The neighbors think I'm—neighbors think I'm—
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Well, motherfucker, I am

[Verse 2]
Some things you can't escape:
Death, taxes, and a ra-
-cist society that make
Every nigga feel like a candidate
For a Trayvon kinda fate
Even when your crib sit on a lake
Even when your plaques hang on a wall
Even when the president jam your tape
Took a little break just to annotate
How I feel, damn, it's late
I can't sleep cause I'm paranoid
Black in a white man territory
Cops bust in with the army guns
No evidence of the harm we done
Just a couple neighbors that assume we slang
Only time they see us we be on the news, in chains, damn
[Bridge]
Don't follow me
Don't follow me
Don't follow me
Don't follow me

[Chorus]
Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
Hm, I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
The neighbors think I'm...neighbors think I'm—
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Well motherfucker, I am

I am, I am, I am
Well, motherfucker, I am

Woke up this morning
Feeling like the best version of me, so happy
I walked in the living room
And saw you all alone on the couch, just napping

There's nowhere I need to be
Except right here with you

With bananas and some almond milk
I never thought I'd see the day

Niggas from the hood is the best actors
We the ones that got to wear our face backwards
Put your frown on before they think you soft
Never smile long or take your defense off
Acting tough so much, we start to feel hard
Live from the city where they pull cards
I got a Glock 40 and a little nine
Ready for the day a nigga pull mine
Niggas from the hood is the best actors
Gotta learn to speak in ways that's unnatural
Just to make it through the job interviews
If my niggas heard me, they'd say
"Damn, what's gotten into you?"
Just trying to make it, dog, somehow
Peeking through the blinds, I see the sun now
I see you're still sleeping and it feels like

To somebody in a world where they not lovin' me
Handcuffs keep huggin' the, wrists of my niggas
And I wish stuff was different here
But if I had a magic wand to make the evil disappear
That means that there would be no Santa Claus no more
To bring you Christmas cheer
'Cause what he represents is really greed
And the need to purchase shit from corporations
That make a killin' because they feed
On the wallets of the poor who be knockin' on they door
Every Black Friday just to get some shit they can't afford
Even with the discount, write a check, that shit bounce
But as long as we got credit, it don't matter, the amount
We just swipin' shit here, we don't love, we just likin' shit here
What's that smell? Where's your diaper shit here?
Lay on your back, don't pee right now
Or else I'll have to get you back
One day when you gon' want to get your way
Yeah I'll have fun with that

Tears of joy I think filled up the room
You are now the reason that I fight
I ain't never did nothing this right in my whole life

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Hey, niggas be dying on the daily
It seems my dreams faded for far too long
The consequences deadly
Can't visualize myself as nothing but a criminal
Control the block, serving up rocks and stay subliminal
'Cause young niggas is hardheaded, they letting off
Full of adrenaline, ignorant to what death can cause
Ain't no coming back, family dressed in black
Plus it's hot now, the cops outside, it's hard to flip a pack
And my daughter gotta eat, her mama be stressing me
Like I ain't the one who put them Jays on her feet
Like I ain't out in the field like that
I might be low for the moment but I will bounce back
Despite the charges, back to the wall, I fight regardless
Screaming, "Fuck the law," my life is lawless
That's what you call it, ain't got to be no psychic
To see this is like the farthest thing from heaven
This is hell and I don't mean that hyperbolic
I try to find employment even if it's wiping toilets
But these felonies be making life the hardest
Resisting the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet
Or run up on your yard, snatch your daughter bike and pawn it
That's why I write this sonnet
If the pressure get too much for me to take and I break
Play this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it

For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
You probably grown now so this song'll hit you
If you hearing this, unfortunately means
That I'm no longer with you in the physical
Not even sure if I believe in God but because you still alive
He got me praying that the spiritual is real
So I can be a part of you still, my pops was killed too
So I know how part of you feels
Maybe you hate me, maybe you miss me, maybe you spite me
Life goes in cycles, maybe you'll date a nigga just like me
I hope not, I'm tired of dope spots
And fiends that smoke rocks
I've seen far too many niggas' hopes rot
I'm writing this because me and the devil had a dance
Now I see death around the corner, 'pologizing in advance
Don't know if I ever had a chance
At a glance, I'm a failure
Addicted to pushing paraphernalia
But Daddy had dreams once, my eyes had a gleam once
Innocence disappeared by the age of eight years
My Pops shot up, drug-related, mama addicted
So Granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging
Blood was staining the concrete
Older niggas I loved talked like they was above
Maintaining a timesheet, that's slow money
Picked up the family business by the age of 13
Six years later was handed sentence
'Round the same time is when you came in this world
Me and your mama thinking:
"What the fuck we naming this girl?"
I told her "Nina," the prettiest name that I could think of
For the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen, I was 19
Took me two felonies to see the trap
This crooked-ass system set for me
And now I fear it's too late for me to ever be
The one that set examples that was never set for me
I'm living fast, but not fast enough
'Cause karma keeps on catching up to me
And if my past becomes the death of me
I hope you understand
[Chorus: J. Cole]
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
It's several ways I could've went out, too many to count
Was it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout?
Was it the young niggas, blasting frustrated
'Cause the cash running out?
Niggas don't know how to act in a drought
See, baby girl, I realized
My definition of a real nigga was skewed
My views misshaped by new mixtapes
That confirmed the shit I learned in the streets was true
That real niggas don't speak when they beef with you
They just pull up on your street, let the heat achoo
And if a real nigga hungry, he gon' eat your food
I was a fool, spent all my time ducking school, ducking cops
Ducking rules, hugging blocks that don't love you
I pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views
Much broader than the corner, if not it's gon' corner you
Into a box, where your son don't even know his pops
And the cyclical nature of doing time continues
My worst fear is one day that you come home from school
And see your father face while hearing 'bout tragedy on news
I got the strangest feeling your daddy gonna lose his life soon
And sadly if you're listening now it must mean it's true
But maybe there's a chance that it's not
And this album remains locked
In a hard drive like valuable jewels
And I can teach you this in person
Like I'm teaching you to tie your own shoes
I love you and I hope to God I don't lose you
For your eyes only
[Chorus: CharGaux & J. Cole]
For your eyes, for your eyes only
For your eyes, for your eyes only
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
One day your daddy called me, told me he had a funny feeling
What he'd been dealing with lately, he wasn't telling
I tried to pick his brains, still he wasn't revealing
But I could feel the sense of panic in his voice
And it was chilling, he said:
"Jermaine, I knew you since we was children
I never asked for nothing, when times was hard
I never had discussions with you, begging you to help me
I dealt with the repercussions of my actions
I know you tried to steer me 'way from that shit
But that shit was in my blood, you know my life
I know your momma, nigga, send my love
In case I never get a chance to speak again
I won't forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib
That's the way I wished my family lived
But my granny crib was in the 'jects"
I had to interject like:
"Nigga, what you talking 'bout? Fuck is you getting at?"
He said, "Listen, I got no time to dive into descriptions
But I been having premonitions
Just call it visions from the other side
I got a feeling I won't see tomorrow
Like the time I'm living on is borrowed
With that said, the only thing I'm proud to say, I was a father
Write my story down, and if I pass
Go play it for my daughter when she ready"
And so I'm leaving you this record, for your eyes only
Don't you ever scratch or disrespect it
This perspective is a real one, another lost 'Ville son
I dedicate these words to you and all the other children
Affected by the mass incarceration in this nation
That sent your pops to prison when he needed education
Sometimes I think that segregation would've done us better
Although I know that means that I would never
Be brought into this world 'cause my daddy was so thrilled
When he found him a white girl to take back to Jonesboro
With lil' Zach and Cole World, barely one years old
Now it's 30 years later, making sure this story's told
Girl, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was cold
Not because he was the first to get some pussy 12 years old
Not because he used to come through in the Caddy on some vogues
Not because he went from bagging up them grams to serving O's
Nah, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was hard
Not because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars
Not because he screamed, "Fuck the law"
Although that was true
Your daddy was a real nigga 'cause he loved you
For your eyes only225EmbedVilluminati Lyrics[Intro: Choir & J. Cole]
I'm a born sinner
But I die better than that, I swear
It's way darker this time
*Laughs*

[Chorus: J. Cole & The Notorious B.I.G.]
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov, now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Cole, time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Sometimes I brag like Hov, sometimes I'm real like Pac
Sometimes I focus on the flow to show the skills I got
Sometimes I focus on the dough, look at these bills I got
This is a message for some rappers tryna steal my spot
You niggas famous on the internet, I'm real life hot, homie
Get your weight up, fake niggas get sprayed up
My verbal AK slay faggots
And I don't mean no disrespect whenever I say faggot, okay, faggot?
Uh, don't be so sensitive
If you want to get fucked in the ass that's between you and whoever else's dick it is
Pause, maybe that line was too far
Just a little joke to show how homophobic you are
And who can blame ya? Boy Meets World, I'm tryna find a new Topanga
And bang her out, no hanging out
My pops was club hopping back when Rick James was out
And all I get is Trinidad James, wait a minute, that's strange
Sip a bit of champagne, say fuck it
If the hoes like it I love it, nigga, nigga, nigga
Used to watch Rap City, Big Tigga, Tigga
Rap nerd, even copped Rah Diggah, Diggah
Pac had a nigga saying fuck Jigga, fuck Biggie
I was only like 11 so forgive me
A decade later I'd be all up in the city
Tryna get Hov to fuck with me
With a burned CD full of jams that was up in my hand
When he said he didn't want it it was fuck him again
One day, he gon' regret playing me
Little did I know in a year he'd be fucking paying me, what could you say to me? I
Beat the odds like Vegas, I used to rap about haters
Before niggas was hating me, now they hate to see
A young black man with a college degree
Fucking all these little models for free, pardon me
[Chorus: J. Cole & The Notorious B.I.G.]
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Got the game back, and I ain’t ever letting go

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
I'm the prince of the city, I studied Machiavelli
You niggas couldn't blow with C4 strapped to your belly
I snuck up out the parts where niggas be living heartless
And cannot tell the difference between Iraqi, Israeli
And so I'm wondering really what could you actually tell me
I'm tryna keep my homie from throwing crack in the skully
So, back with this pen to give back for my sins
Took a black president to tell the Japanese sorry
But who the fuck gon' tell my niggas sorry
Never seen his pops 'cause he's sorry
Fucked up education, would ask for reparations
But I’m probably just gon' go and buy Ferraris, vroom
Please forgive him
According to the preacher man he needs Jesus in him
But the Devil run the TV so the demons in 'em
I'm in trouble
Did a deal with the Devil, now I'm pleading with him
Like give me my soul
[Bridge: J. Cole]
My nigga, I ain't ever letting you go again
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again
Please give me my soul
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again
Please give me my soul
I ain't ever letting go
But the Devil don't play fair

I'm 'bout to go and join the Illuminati
Fuck everybody
I'm 'bout to go and join the Illuminati
Fuck everybody
I'm 'bout to go and join the Illuminati
Fuck everybody
I'm 'bout to go and join the Illuminati

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
These next three bars is dedicated to the retards
Keep on asking me about the Illuminati;
Is you stupid, nigga? Young black millionaire
Old white billionaires, I'm sure that they can do without me
And I ain't really into sacrificing human bodies
Couple more A's I would've been a summa cuma laude
Beyoncé told me that she want to cop the blue Bugatti
That shit is more than what I'm worth, I think she knew it probably
Well this is awkward, awkward
Want to know what else is really awkward, awkward
When niggas buy rings for bitches I had flings with
I'm praying I don't see 'em at the Oscars, Oscars

[Interlude: J. Cole]
Hey J. Cole, this way, hey
Oh, hey, what's up? What's goin' on with you? Okay
Big smile, man, big smile, let me see that crooked smile
J. Cole, J. Cole, this way, look this way
Oh friend hug, friend hug, just keep it friendly
We friends, friends

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
Re-adjustin' my target audience, 'cause it's obvious
I've gone astray, losing my way like Timberlake
Produced by Timbaland on that goddamn FutureSex/LoveSounds
What's playing in my mind, just the sound of my whole career
Crash and burning, the thing that I mostly fear
Was on track for the first two years until I let the Devil steer
Now what have we here? Mask my tears, but I

I ain't ever letting you go again
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again

Well, this is pastor Kerney Thomas and I literally have tens and thousands across this country
That were hurting but God done heal them
And God could work a miracle for them"

This the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street with
Lord, know some hoes from the past
Like, "Damn Cole, wish I knew that you would be rich"
Well, shoulda asked
It's funny how these niggas on some real "be cool with me" shit
I bag two bitches like it's two of me, bitch
This the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street with
Finally got my own bedroom in this bitch
No more sleeping in my brother room
Like, "Man, I might as well be sleeping in my mother room"
'Cause how I'm supposed to sneak hoes with my bro here?
Plus she gon' find out I been rocking all his old gear
This his flow here, this is no fair, this is so pure
This is so clear, this is one breath, this is no air
Ain't no wedding but I do the most here
I'm the President, you the co-chair
You the player, yeah, I'm the coach here, nigga, I coast here
This weather got me set up on this West Coast, yeah
Avoidin' the snakes, AKs, and coke, yeah
Get my dick wet, but I never let it soak there
Man, I been thinkin' 'bout movin' out
What? Country boy in the city
Of New York nine years, ran that shit like Diddy
Riding through South Side Queens like Fiddy
[Chorus]
Nothing's impossible
And all you lame niggas show me what not to do
I met a real bad bitch in the club tonight
She told me, "Watch the snakes 'cause they watching you"
I told her, "Awww baby don't start!
I ain't looking for the way to your heart!"
She said, "You 'bout to miss church" while she riding me
I like my sundaes with a cherry on top
Make that ass drop (drop, drop)
Hey make that ass drop (drop, drop)
Hey make that ass drop (drop, drop)
Hey make that ass drop (drop, drop, drop)

[Verse 2]
Now if you only had one wish is it devious?
'Cause you already know who your genie is
Ain't get a cover now your mag on my penis
Like damn, he turned out to be a genius
Damn, real shit nigga, no Pixar
You niggas soft like Meagan Good's lips are
My kicks hard, my whip hard
I came out the womb with my dick hard
Back when I was playing Stomp the Yard
It'd be a bunch of niggas up on campus talking hard
Don't get exposed to these hoes boy, knock it off
I seen your mama in the Benz when she dropped you off
Damn, now who more thorough than me?
I paint a picture of my pain for the world to see
Could paint a picture of the game but my girl would see
Gotta ask myself, "What mean the world to me?"
Me, me
[Chorus]
Nothing's impossible
And all you lame niggas show me what not to do
I met a real bad bitch in the club tonight
She told me, "Watch the snakes 'cause they watching you"
I told her, "Aw baby don't start!
I ain't looking for the way to your heart!"
She said, "You bout to miss church" while she riding me
I like my sundaes with a cherry on top

[Verse 3]
This the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street wit'
Yeah
This the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street wit'
A little Fayettenam nigga out in Beverly Hills
That's when I ran into this chick I went to college with
Yeah, back when a nigga was on scholarship
Was in a rush, but I still stopped to holla, shit
That's the least I owed her 'cause see I tried to hit
On the first night, and nah, I ain't proud of it
I boned her in my dorm room and kicked her out of it, huh
And I never called back, how thoughtfulless
Now I'm standing in the streets tryna politic with her
In her mind she calling me a misogynist, nigga
On some Bobby Brown shit, my prerogative, nigga
Is to hit and never commit
Not realizing when I hit she never forgets
So every time I ignore the telephone call
Saying I'll hit her back knowing I'm never gon' call, she was hurtin'
Now she's staring dead in my face, she was smirking
Like, "Yeah, I remember and nah you ain't worth shit, nigga
You ain't worth shit, nigga"

Okay, back when I was sleeping in my mama crib
Or even back when I was up there in Mohammed crib
Paying seventeen hundred for the rent, money well spent
No heater, but a nigga made heat, may I vent?
Had a thing for ya, even wrote the song "Dreams" for ya
‘Cause I had dreams for ya, thoughts of a ring for ya
Childish shit, you know child and shit
Anonymous flowers sent, you know coward shit
Now a nigga signed to Hov, took a power trip
Back home, I'm grown now, and the city's my throne now, huh
The same clubs that I used to get tossed out
Life got Kriss Kross'd: totally crossed out
‘Cause now I'm in this bitch and I'm totally bossed out
Old chicks crying ‘cause they know that they lost out
But I'm still on you, I'm still on you
My drink spill on me, while I feel on you, I'm sayin'—

If I ever get to fuck it'd be the longest bust ever
Love is a drug, like the strongest stuff ever and
Fuck it, I'm on one, you feel me?
She on a power trip, she got me where she want a nigga
Wife'ing in the club, man, my homies gon' disown a nigga
Like, "Give me twenty dollars, dollars!"
Ass stupid, how you get to college, college?
I'm in your city and I'm wonderin' if you're home now
Went and found a man, but I'm hopin' you're alone now
Can't help but feeling like I dropped the ball, cliché
I used to pop up on you at the mall each day
Now, typically I kick game like Eastbay
But you got a nigga freeze-framed yelling: "Please play!"
For Pete's sake, homie, pull it together
Just fuck her one time and be through with forever, but—

Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?

So much money I don't know who stole from me
Hard to keep track I'm used to having no money
Still broke compared to niggas with old money
I mean the type of niggas that laugh at Hov money
Billionaires with petroleum and coal money
Probably kill they selves if they had Cole money
Talk shit and I'ma see you like you owe money
I'm wrapping up the album, fourth quarter I'm so money
I'm overseas looking for trees to grow money
Peter Popoff, robbing people for hope money
Prostitutes collecting that "let me stroke" money
Put up a couple dollars for the liquor store money
Used to dread the strip club cause I couldn't throw money
Now the strippers give a nigga the throat for no money
How mama gonna teach you how to save your money
When she barely on the boat, got stay afloat money
Blacks always broke cause we don't know money
Spend it 'fore we get it and could never hold money
No wallets, nah, nigga we'd rather fold money

Yeah, god flow
Paint a picture like a young Pablo, Picasso
Niggas say "Live fast, die young," so I drive slow
And pray I die old
In the drop with the top low
Met a bad bitch from Chicago, my hat wasn't cocked, yo
Kept it straight, shit, cause y'all know
And if not, you'll learn how them niggas in the Chi go
I ain't fuck her, but I'm thinking 'bout it
My niggas say why you gotta think about it?
The bitch want too much, hit my phone too much
If I gotta be frank about it
Ain't worth the stress
First the text, then the draws, see first is sex
Then it's calls cause the bird's obsessed
Want flowers, cards, and the purses next
Nah, bitch can't get a dollar
Cole on Twitter, bitch can't get a follow
Can get a nut, heard "Can't Get Enough"
Now she fuck a nigga thinking that she may have hit the lotto
No way, Jose
Could write a book called, "The Things Hoes Say"
Show a lot of love to my sisters though
But these bitches so predictable
I'm in trouble
[Chorus]

And I'm going back to school
Only for the hoes and a class or two
Young bad bitch made the pastor drool
Everybody sweat her like Catholic school
Sat next to her in the back of the class
Cheated off her test and I'm grabbing her ass
She like "Don't you know this shit already?"
"Nigga, ain't you rich already?"
Yeah, but I got dumb as shit
Hanging 'round these rappers 'cause they dumb as shit
But I'm back on track, jump shot wasn't that good
Couldn't sell crack but I rap good
That's one stereotype
Know a lot of niggas that'll marry your type
Bad bitch with a degree, I let 'em scoop ya
I'm Koopa, I never been the Mario type
No saving hoes
I ain't fooled cause a lot of cool bitches that a nigga went to school with is major hoes
And they mans don't know, they mans don't know, fo' sho

"Mama, did you fuck J. Cole?"

Married men act totally different when they're by themselves, don't they? You see 'em with their wife, "What's up Tony?" "Hey man, how's everything going brother? Oh, just taking it easy, hanging out with the old lady. Alright, God bless you, take it easy now, alright." You be like that nigga ain't like that
You see him by himself, "What's up Tony?" "Hey, where's the bitches at, nigga?! Where's the bitches?!"

[Verse 1]
Yeah
Gimme my space, Lord, ain't enough time to chase
All these dreams, nah mean? I got no time to wait
Love my girl, but I told her straight up, "Don't wait up"
Stumble home late, I'm drunk, we fucked and made up
Used to living free as a bird, but now I'm laid up
Feelin' like a nigga got handcuffs on
How the fuck did my life become a damn love song?
She ride for a nigga and she stand up for him
But a nigga wan' be a nigga, be a nigga
Ride through the streets with freaks and real niggas
She'll never understand what it's like to be a man
Knowin' when you look inside yourself you see a nigga
And you don't wan' let her down
But you too young for the settle down
And maybe you can thug it out, learn what is love about
When you can't live with her and you can't live without
Aw shit, goddamn, I think the devil got his hands on me
Stripper saying, "Baby, won't you throw them bands on me?"
And I came to spend
She pop a molly, let the motherfuckin' games begin
I'm running away
[Chorus]
Runaway, runaway
Runaway, runaway
I'm holdin' on
Desperately
Runaway, runaway
Runaway, runaway
I'm holdin' on
[Verse 2]
When it's all said and done everybody dies
In this life ain't no happy endings
Only pure beginnings followed by years of sinning and fake repentance
The preacher say we were made in image of Lord
To which I replied: "Are you sure?
Even a murderer? Even a whore?
Even a nigga running through bitches on tour
With a good girl at home folding clothes and shit?"
She losin' faith in him and he knows the shit, like, "What the fuck is a break?
Don't know how much I can take no more
I give you all I got 'til it ain't no more
No more tears, it's been ten long years
Damn near, I don't know if I can wait no more"
And who can blame her, you complain about
Every time you out, you come back she poutin'
Sleeping back to back, this is wack, we 'bout
To go platinum and I'm in the crib acting out
My childhood fantasies of wife and home
But it's a whole lot of actresses I'd like to bone
And despite the rumors you hold out
On account of your guilt and she has got to spend her nights alone
And she ride or die like Eve and 'em
Make home-cooked meals every evenin'
And even in your lowest days
When you're no longer Superman, at least you know you got Lois Lane
But you
[Chorus]
Runaway, runaway
Runaway, runaway
I'm holdin' on
Desperately
Runaway, runaway
Runaway, runaway
I'm holdin' on
[Verse 3]
Yeah
Unbelievable, seen evil that not even Knievel know
At age three I knew this world was three below
Listen, even though my ego low, achieved the unachievable
Imagine if my confidence was halfway decent yo
This just in, fucked more bitches than Bieber though
Still I keep it low, got my niggas on the need to know
Basis, my manager back in the days was racist
I was a young boy, passing skates and tucking laces
Old perverted white man who told me, "Jermaine
It's all pink on the inside, fuck what color they face is"
Wise words from an indecent man
Made me reflect on the times when we was three-fifths of them
In chains and powerless, brave souls reduced to cowardice
Slaving in the baking sun for hours just
To see the master creep into the shack where your lady at
Nine months later got a baby, that's
Not quite what you expected, but you
Refuse to neglect it, 'cause you
Know your wifey loves you, thus you refuse to accept it
That’s the type of shit that turned my granny light-skinned
Rich white men rule the nation still
Only difference is we all slaves now, the chains concealed
In our thoughts, if I follow my heart to save myself
Could I run away from fifty-mill like Dave Chappelle?
You know
[Chorus]
Runaway, runaway
Runaway, runaway
I'm holdin' on
Desperately
Runaway, runaway
Runaway, runaway
I'm holdin' on78Embed She Knows Lyrics[Intro: J. Cole & Amber Coffman (Sampled)]
She knows
She knows, ayy
Bad things happen to the people you love
And you find yourself praying up to heaven above
But honestly, I've never had much sympathy
'Cause those bad things, I always saw them coming for me
I'm gonna run, run away (Oh, I), run run away, run away (Oh, I-I-I)
Run away and never come back (Well, all right)
Run run away, run run away (Oh, I), run away (Oh, I-I-I)
Show 'em that your color is black (Well, all right)
[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Damned if I do, damned if I don't
You know I got a girl back home
You got a man what you want, what you want?
What these bitches want from a nigga?
On some DMX shit, huh
I know them other niggas love tricking
On some BMX shit, but not me
Now I'm sure you done heard about me
A black star, Mos Def, Kweli
Good so them bad hoes try me, they try me
This is Martin Luther King in the club, getting dubs
With a bad bitch in his ear, sayin' that she down for whatever
In the back of his mind is Coretta

[Chorus: J. Cole]
And she knows, she knows
And I know she knows, and I know she knows
And deep down, she knows, she knows
And I know she knows, and I know she knows

[Refrain: J. Cole with Amber Coffman]
Well, all right, oh, I, oh, I-I-I
I can't be what you want from me, well, all right
Oh, I, oh, I-I-I
I can't be what you want from me, well, all right
[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Damned if I do, shit, damned if I don't
I'm passing up on bad hoes
Trying to be the man that she want, what she want?
What she—What she want from a nigga?
To put a ring on it
Got a bitch on my dick right now
And she just want to sing on it
Got me up so high, try and get a piece of that apple pie
I be up so high, try and get a piece of that apple pie
Dancehall vibes with my pants on fire
'Cause I told her I was sleep
'Cause I creep with this pretty young thing that I chose
She could be doing the same thing, I suppose

[Chorus: J. Cole]
And she knows, she knows
And I know she knows, and I know she knows
And deep down, she knows, she knows
And I know she knows, and I know she knows

[Refrain: J. Cole with Amber Coffman]
Well, all right, oh, I, oh, I-I-I
I can't be what you want from me, well, all right
Oh, I, oh, I-I-I
I can't be what you want from me, well, all right

Niggas say, "Turn up," hoes say, "Turn up"
Only bad thing 'bout a star is they burn up
Niggas say, "Turn up," hoes say, "Turn up"
Only bad thing 'bout a star is they burn up
Rest in peace to Aaliyah
Rest in peace to Left Eye (Left Eye)
Michael Jackson, I'll see ya
Just as soon as I die (I die)

Got me up so high, try and get a piece of that apple pie, uh

Ayo, ayo, ayo, ah, ayo, ah
Ayo, ayo, ayo, ah
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I hate rich niggas, god damn it
'Cause I ain't never had a lot, damn it
Who you had to kill? Who you had to rob?
Who you had to fuck just to make it to the top, damn it?
Or maybe that's daddy money, escalator, no ladder money
Escalade, new Caddy money
Worst fear going broke cause I'm bad with money
Crooked smile nigga, momma never had the money, damn
I ain't tripping
Nigga Jordan and I ain't Pippen, yeah
Up the steps, I ain't slipping
Tears, blood, sweat, and I ain't cripping
Here's a song you can sing along with
When you down on some let you know you ain't alone shit
When your momma ain't at home cause she got a second job
Delivering pizzas, you think she out here getting robbed
Please God watch her I know how niggas do
Half cracker but a nigga too
Talking all that shit 'bout your step-pops
How he was a dog, now look at you
I ain't bad as that nigga, plus dawg, I'm a grown man now
I ain't mad at that nigga
But if a plane crashed and it only killed his lame ass
I'd be glad it's that nigga, nigga
Did Kay dirty now it's back to broke
Refund checks, used that to float
Momma gets depressed, falls in love with the next maniac
On crack, use that to cope
Make a nigga smoke a whole sack of dope
Writing rhymes, tryna bring back the hope
Try to ride the storm out and crashed the boat
Could've drowned, but I grabbed the rope
[Pre-Chorus]
And there go you, and there go you, and there go you
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew
And there go you, and there go you, and there go you
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew

[Chorus]
Sing, you got what I want, I got what you need
"How much for your soul, Anna?"
"How much for your soul, Anna?"
You got what I want, I got what you need
"How much for your soul, Anna?"
"How much for your soul, Anna?"
[Verse 2]
I hate rich niggas, god damn it
'Cause I ain't never had a lot, damn it
Niggas can't front on the flows you got
But every fucking verse how much dough you got
Homie, don't quit now
Hear my shit and tried to switch now
Know you felt the shit just now, know you felt the shit just now
Ain't there more to you? Don't it ever get boring to you?
I realize deep down you a coward getting high off of power, fuck it more to you
Saw through you and it made me ashamed that I played the game
Not for mo' money like Damon Wayans
Wanted the respect but it came with fame
I just wanted love but this ain't the same
I took a train down memory lane
And watched lil Jermaine do his thang before he made a name
It's like Sony signed Basquiat
He gave it all he got, and now a nigga don't paint the same, damn
I guess he can't complain
All the money that be raining in
Spend a hundred thou for the chain again
Think of old school niggas like Dana Dane
Probably kill for another claim to fame, my brain the same
Yeah, nigga, at least he ain't insane
At least he ain't insane
You ain't crazy, motherfucker, you just afraid of change
That's new, maybe that's true
But listen here, I got a bigger fear
Of one day that I become you
When I become lost and I become heartless
And numb from all the Ménages
Just one bitch don't feel the same no more
And Henny don't really kill the pain no more
Now I'm Cobain with a shotgun aimed at my brain
Cause I can't maintain no more
Tad bit extreme I know
Money can't save your soul
But there go you
[Pre-Chorus]
And there go you, and there go you, and there go you
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew
And there go you, and there go you, and there go you
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew

[Chorus]
Sing, you got what I want, I got what you need
"How much for your soul, Anna?"
"How much for your soul, Anna?"
You got what I want, I got what you need
"How much for your soul, Anna?"
"How much for your soul, Anna?"

[Chorus: J. Cole & Kendrick Lamar]
Me and my bitch, took a little trip
Down to the garden, took a little dip (Oh no)
Apple juice falling from her lips, took a little sip
Lil' sip, took a lil' sip
Took a lil' sip, t-took a lil', took a lil', took a lil' sip

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Ayo, I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
Where niggas hold tech's like they mad at the ref
That's why I keep a cross on my chest, either that or a vest
Do you believe that Eve had Adam in check
And if so, you gotta expect
To sip juice from the forbidden fruit and get loose
Cole is the king, most definite
My little black book thicker than the Old Testament
Niggas pay for head but the pussy sold separate
Same bitch giving brains to the minister
The same reason they call Mr. Cee the finisher
Forbidden fruit, watch for the Adam's apple
Slick with words don't hate me, son
What you eat don't make me shit and who you fuck don't make me cum
Put a price on my head won't make me run
Try to kill me but it can't be done
'Cause my words gon' live forever
You put two and two together Cole here forever

Me and my bitch, took a little trip
Down to the garden, took a little dip (Oh no)

Take a seat baby girl you've been all in my mind
I know I ain't called gotta pardon my grind
Just copped a maroon 5, no Adam Levine
'Came a man by myself, only father was time
I know that she relate baby daddy ain't shit
So she raised that nigga kids but she swallowing mine
And that's why you all on my mind
All on my line like caller number nine
'Cause a nigga poppin' like Harlem in the nine-seven
Way before Mase was a reverend
I was a young nigga making A's at 11
Or 12, trying to get a taste of the Heaven
Or Hell, only time gon' tell
Fuck her while her mama home, "baby, don't yell"
How many records do a nigga gotta sell
Just to get the cover of the XXL
Or Fader, fuck your magazine hater
When I say that I'm the greatest I ain't talking about later
I'ma drop the album same day as Kanye
Just to show the Boyz the man now like Wanyá
And I don't mean no disrespect, I praise legends
But this what's next, the boy sick, can't disinfect
Life's a bitch and her pussy's wet
My clip is loaded and this is the kiss of... death

Forreal

[Verse 1]
Look at me, pathetic nigga, this chain that I bought
You mix greed, pain and fame, this is heinous result
Let these words be the colors, I'm just paintin' my heart
I'm knee-deep in the game and it ain't what I thought
Copped a Range Rover, my girl got the Mercedes
Iced out crazy, I wanna shine like Baby
Compared to that nigga I ain't even got a bib yet
Truth be told I ain't even bought a crib yet
This is everything they told a nigga not to do
Image is everything I see, it got a lot to do
With the way people perceive, and what they believe
Money short so this jewelry is like a weave
Meant to deceive and hear niggas say: "I see you"
Now bitches wanna fuck you and niggas wanna be you
And police wanna stop you, frisk you wonder what he do
If a hater snatch your chain, I bet it still won't free you
'Cause I be right back grinding 'til I cop another
I sit and think about all this shit I coulda copped my mother
My partner said that's just the game my nigga
Swear I heard my jeweler say, "Here go your chain my nigga"
This is chaining day
[Chorus]
I need you to love me (Chaining day), love me (Ohh my chaining day)
I need you to love me (My chaining day), love me
My last piece, I swear
My guilt heavy as this piece I wear (Love me, love me, hey hey)
They even iced out Jesus' hair
My last piece, I swear (Love me, love me)
They even iced out Jesus' hair

[Verse 2]
Ice on this white Jesus seem a little unholy
The real strange thing about this iced out Roley
It's the same shit a broke black nigga get gassed at
Same shit a rich white motherfucka laugh at
Well laugh on white man, I ain't paid as you
But I bet your rims ain't the same age as you
And I ain't got no investment portfolio
But my black and white diamonds shinin' like a Oreo
I know back home a nigga sick today
He rock a chain and he always got some shit to say
Even back when I was broke I knew his shit was fake
He'd prolly sneeze too hard and his shit could break
But hey, you know the sayin', "Fake it 'til you make it"
Me, I did the opposite, made it then I faked it
And acted like I gave a fuck, money I was savin' up
To buy a crib that's gated 'til hundred racks, I gave it up
For what
[Chorus]
I need you to love me (Chaining day), love me (Ohh, my chaining day)
I need you to love me (My chaining day), love me
My last piece, I swear
My guilt heavy as this piece I wear (Love me, love me, hey hey)
They even iced out Jesus' hair
My last piece, I swear (Love me, love me)

Lord, this is the last time (hehe)
Told my accountant, "It's the last time
I swear this is the last time
I know that I said that shit last time
But this the last time"
Mama I swear this is the last time
So don't take my chains from me
This the last time
'Cause I chose this slavery
This is the last time
Don't take my chains from me
This is the last time
'Cause I love this slavery

On my way, on my way, on my way down
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round
[Verse 1: J. Cole]
They tell me I should fix my grill ‘cause I got money now
I ain't gon' sit around and front like I ain't thought about it
A perfect smile is more appealing, but it's funny how
My shit is crooked—look at how far I done got without it!
I keep my twisted grill, just to show the kids it's real
We ain't picture perfect, but we worth the picture still
I got smart, I got rich and I got bitches still
And they all look like my eyebrows: thick as hell
Love yourself, girl, or nobody will
Though you a woman I don't know how you deal
With all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels
I feel for you, killin' yourself to find a man that'll kill for you
You wake up, put makeup on
Stare in the mirror, but it's clear that you can’t face what’s wrong
No need to fix what God already put his paintbrush on
Your roommate yelling, "Why you gotta take so long?!"
What it's like to have a crooked smile

To all the women with the flaws, know it's hard, my darling
You wonder why you're lonely and your man's not calling
You keep falling victim ‘cause you're insecure
And when I tell you that you're beautiful you can't be sure
‘Cause he don't seem to want you back and it's got you askin'
So all you see is what you lackin', not what you packin'
Take it from a man that loves what you got
And baby girl, you a star, don't let 'em tell you you're not
Now is it real? Eyebrows, fingernails, hair
Is it real? If it's not, girl, you don't care
‘Cause what's real is somethin' that the eyes can't see
That the hands can’t touch, that them broads can’t be
And that’s you, never let 'em see your frown
And if you need a friend to pick you up, I’ll be around
And we can ride with the windows down, the music loud
I can tell you ain’t laughed in a while
But I wanna see that crooked smile

We don't look nothin' like the people on the screen
You know, the movie stars, picture perfect beauty queens
But we got dreams and we got the right to chase ‘em

Seem like half the race is either on probation or in jail
Wonder why we inhale, ‘cause we in Hell already

But one more time for the 'Ville
And fuck all of that beef shit, nigga, let’s make a mil
Hey officer man, we don’t want nobody gettin' killed
Just open up that cell, let my brother outta jail
I got money for the bail now, and well now
If you askin' will I tell now—ayy, hell nah
I ain’t snitchin' 'cause, man, they get them niggas stitches now
If you was around then you wouldn’t need a witness now
How you like this crooked smile?

[Music Video]229Embed Let Nas Down Lyrics[Produced by J. Cole & Nate Jones]

[Intro]
Freedom or jail, clips inserted, a baby's bein' born
Same time my man is murdered; the beginning and end
As far as rap go, it's only natural, I explain
My plateau, and also what defines my name

[Refrain]
Yeah, long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
'Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you 'bout to hear is a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin
[Verse 1]
I used to print out Nas raps and tape 'em up on my wall
My niggas thought they was words, but it was pictures I saw
And since I wanted to draw, I used to read them in awe
Then he dropped Stillmatic, rocked the cleanest velour
Fast forward, who'd a thought that I would meet him on tour
I'm earnin' stripes now, a nigga got Adidas galore
Backstage I shook his hand, let 'em know that he's the man
When he said he was a fan it was too hard to understand
No time to soak up the moment though ‘cause I was in a jam
Hov askin' where's the record that the radio could play
And I was strikin' out for months, 9th inning, feelin' fear
Jeter under pressure, made the biggest hit of my career
But at first, that wasn't clear, niggas had no idea
Dion called me when it dropped, sounded sad but sincere
Told me Nas heard your single and he hate that shit
Said, "You the one, yo, why you make that shit?"

[Chorus]
I can't believe I let Nas down
Damn, my heart sunk to my stomach
I can't believe I let Nas down
I got defensive on the phone
Resentment was in my tone, fuck it

[Refrain]
Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
'Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin
[Verse 2]
I couldn't help but think that maybe I had made a mistake
I mean, you made "You Owe Me"
Dog, I thought that you could relate
But while I shot up the charts
You mean tellin' me that I was not up to par
When I followed my heart
Granted, my heart was tainted
By my mind that kept on sayin'
"Where's the hits?" You ain't got none
You know Jay'll never put your album out without none
And, dog, you know how come
Labels are archaic, formulaic with they outcome
They don't know, they just study the charts
Me, I studied the shows, the fans, study they hearts
I had a feelin' I was killin', and this music we were spillin' out
Would change lives forever, fuck the label, put it out
Friday Night Lights blew, that was classic number two
Now it seemed as if the Nas comparisons was comin' true
Still no release date from the label, are they insane?
Gucc told me play the game to change the game

[Chorus]
But on the way I let Nas down
I got no one to blame
I'm ashamed, I let Nas down
But this is God's plan, you can never understand, fuck it
[Refrain]
Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
'Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin
[Verse 3]
I always believed in the bigger picture
If I could get them niggas to listen outside my core
Then I can open the door
Reintroduce 'em to honesty, show 'em that they need more
The difference between the pretenders and the Kendrick Lamars
And so, I took the fall
Like the son of the Lord on the cross
Dyin' for that fake shit you niggas bought
For the past decade
If I should pass, please let this be my last essay
Therefore I write from the heart
Apologies to OG's for sacrificin' my art
But I'm here for a greater purpose
I knew right from the start
I'm just a man of the people, not above but equal
And for the greater good I walk amongst the evil
Don't cry, Mama, this the life I choose myself
Just pray along the way that I don't lose myself
This is for the nigga that said that Hip-Hop was dead
I went to Hell to resurrect it
How could you fail to respect it?

[Chorus]
Letting Nas down, I got the phone call
Quietly I mourned, dog, I let Nas down
Yeah, and on this flight
May I never lose sight, fuck it

[Refrain]
Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
'Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible

Yeah
Hey

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Spinning in circles, live my life without rehearsal
If I died today my nigga, was it business, was it personal?
Should this be my last breath I'm blessed 'cause it was purposeful
Never got to church to worship lord but please be merciful
You made me versatile, well-rounded like cursive
Know you chose me for a purpose, I put my soul in these verses
Born sinner, was never born to be perfect
Sucker for women licking they lips and holding these purses
Back when we ran the streets who would think we'd grow to be murderers?
Teachers treated niggas as if they totally worthless
And violent, and hopeless, I saw but never noticed
That a college point is right to "Be all that you can be" posters, uh
Rest in peace to Tiffany, I don't know if
This the realest shit I wrote, but know the realest nigga wrote this
And signed it, and sealed it in a envelope and knew one day you'll find it
And knew one day you'd come back and rewind it, singing
[Chorus: James Fauntleroy]
I'm a born sinner
But I'll die better than that, I swear
You were always where I needed you to be
Whether you were there or not there (I was there)
I was born sinning
But I live better than that (better than that)
If you ain't fucking with that, I don't care
(Ooh, ooh, ooh) Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Yeah, this music shit is a gift
But God help us make it 'cause this music biz is a cliff
I got her life in my grip, she holding tight to my wrist
She screaming, "Don't let me slip"
She see the tears in my eyes, I see the fear on her lips
True when I told you, "You the only reason why I don't flip
And go insane," my roof in the pouring rain
You knew me before the fame, don't lose me the more I change, no
Just grow with me, go broke you go broke with me
I smoke you gon' smoke with me
Woman's curse since birth, man lead her to the hearse
I go Bobby, you go Whitney, damn
Listen here, I'll tell you my biggest fears
You the only one who knows 'em
Don't you ever go expose 'em
This life is harder than you'll probably ever know
Emotions I hardly ever show, more for you than for me
Don't you worry yourself, I gotta do this for me
They tell me life is a test, but where's the tutor for me?
Pops came late, I'm already stuck in my ways
Ducking calls from my mother for days
Sometimes she hate the way she raised me but she love what she raised
Can't wait to hand her these house keys with nothing to say
Except
[Chorus: James Fauntleroy]
I'm a born sinner
But I'll die better than that, I swear
You were always where I needed you to be
Whether you were there or not there (I was there)

If you ain't fucking with that, I don't care

My thoughts are racing all the time
There is no reason or no rhyme
I'm trapped inside myself

A newborn baby has two primary modes of communication
Laughter, which says, "I love this"
Or crying, which says, "This frightens me, I'm in pain"
Life can bring much pain
There are many ways to deal with this pain
Choose wisely
At the bottom of the hourglass
Lies sand that represents the past
In which all of my demons rest
I'm calling out for help
There are many ways to deal with this pain
Choose wisely
Choose wisely, choose wisely, choose wisely, choose wisely
Choose wisely, choose wisely, choose wisely, choose wisely
Choose wisely, choose wisely, choose wisely

How does it feel now that you on?
How much you worth? How big is your home?
How come you won't get a few features?
I think you should? How 'bout I don't?
How 'bout you just get the fuck off my dick?
How 'bout you listen and never forget?
Only gon' say this one time, then I'll dip

He serve a few packs and he jack a Mercedes
He shoot at the police, he clap at old ladies
He don't give a fuck if them crackers gon' hang him

I'ma be the bigger man just like I always be
Eventually but right now that's hard for me
I'm dreaming violent, I can't tolerate disloyalty
So I'ma see you when I see you, know that day comin'
I pray that on that day you slip and say something
I never fantasize 'bout murder 'cause I'm still sane
But I can't seem to fight this urge to make you feel pain
I know that vengeance is the Lord's and it's not for me
I know the punishment for you is that you not with me
You place your value on the bitches that you got with me
And now the bitches ask you daily "Why you not with me?"
I had to cut some people off 'cause they was using me
My heart is big, I want to give too much and usually
I send the bread and don't hear back for like two months now
You hit my phone, you need a loan, oh I'm a crutch now
I had to learn, I never had shit
You never would split, you was hood rich
I couldn't get a dollar from you I remember that
It was blurry for a while but now it's coming back (coming back)

If the work good I'll be back for the re-up

Monkey on my back and I walk a hundred miles
Guilt make a nigga feel fake when he smile
Love get confused in the mind of a child
'Cause love wouldn't lie like I lie and it's wild
Wanna have my cake and another cake too
Even if the baker don't bake like you
Even when the flavor don't taste like you
So I'm back mobbing with the late night crew
All in your mind with fears that would come true
The back of my mind, the back of my mind was you
Wishing that I could blind myself from view
And only have eyes, and only have eyes for you

Coming here with that bullshit," hah
[Verse 1]
Niggas hating on me, I ain't used to that
Know a couple people wanna shoot for that
I say "No, no, no, chill, it ain't no need for that"
Them niggas tryna blow and ain't need me for that
And if it work for them, well shit, I'm cool with that
'Cause how they feel, I ain't got shit to do with that
I just sit back on cool and watch my paper stack
And trip off how much bread them crackers take from that

[Bridge]
It's been a long time since I have felt this way
About something but now, but now
I'm controlling my mind, the days are warm
The nights are cold, the lost is found, I'm found
Lord knows I need something to fill this void
Lord knows I need something to fill this void
Lord knows I need something to fill this void
Lord knows I need something to fill this void
[Interlude]
Hell yeah boy, I'm a goddamn millionaire now
Hell yeah, nigga, they can't tell me shit now, bro, hell no, fuck that
Bitch, got my first motherfuckin' million dollar check nigga
I'm goddamn lit boy, you crazy as hell
Hold up, it's my phone real quick, it's my Unc'
Uncle Sam and shit
"What's up Unc'? Yup. Hey, I told you that check was coming in, I gotchu when it came in. Goddamn, I'm a man of my word. Goddamn, I told you I'ma have it, and goddamn, I'ma have it for you. Hell, shit, damn right. Now, how much was it though? Uh huh. Huh? Half? Half nigga? You crazy, boy, you crazy. Bitch, you crazy as fuck. Bitch, bitch, you better suck half my dick!

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I pay taxes, so much taxes, shit don't make sense
Where do my dollars go? You see lately, I ain't been convinced
I guess they say my dollars supposed to build roads and schools
But my niggas barely graduate, they ain't got the tools
Maybe 'cause the tax dollars that I make sure I send
Get spent hirin' some teachers that don't look like them
And the curriculum be tricking them, them dollars I spend
Got us learning about the heroes with the whitest of skin
One thing about the men that's controlling the pen
That write history, they always seem to white-out they sins
Maybe we'll never see a black man in the White House again
I'll write a check to the IRS, my pockets get slim
Damn, do I even have a say 'bout where it's goin'?
Some older nigga told me to start votin'
I said "Democracy is too fuckin' slow"
If I'm givin' y'all this hard-earned bread, I wanna know
Better yet, let me decide, bitch, it's 2018
Let me pick the things I'm funding from an app on my screen
Better that than letting wack congressman I've never seen
Dictate where my money go, straight into the palms of some Money-hungry company that make guns that circulate the country And then wind up in my hood, making bloody clothes
Stray bullet hit a young boy with a snotty nose
From the concrete, he was prolly rose
Now his body froze and nobody knows what to tell his mother
He did good at the white man schools unlike his brother
Who was lost in the streets all day, not using rubbers
So right now, he got two on the way
Still sleep on covers in his mama house
She can't take this shit no more, she want him out
On the morning of the funeral, just as she's walking out
Wiping tears away, grabbing her keys and sunglasses
She remember that she gotta file her taxes, damn
[Chorus]
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Right, right, right, right
Something's got a hold on me
Right, right, right, right
Sometimes I think pain is just a lack of understanding
If we could only understand it all, would we feel no pain?
God must feel no pain
Something's got a hold on me
Only joy
Does this mean even our suffering pleases him?
[Verse]
Lost in a cloud of marijuana
Young Carolina nigga, fish out of water
Step-daddy just had a daughter with another woman
Mama ain't recover yet
Callin' me at 12 at night
She drunk as fuck and I'm upset
'Cause why she always using me for crutch?
Growin' up I used to always see her up
Late as shit, cigarette smoke and greatest hits from Marvin Gaye
She kill a whole bottle of some cheap chardonnay
I gotta leave this house 'cause part of me dies when I see her like this
Too young to deal with pain
I'd rather run the streets than see her kill herself
So 'Ville became my escape from a feelin' I hate
Mama cursing me out
Depression's such a villainous state
I used to stay out later on purpose
Subconsciously I was nervous that if I came home early then what would surface was her inner demons
And then I'd have to end up seein' my hero on ground zero
Tears flow while Al Green blow
Love and happiness
I wish that I could say the right words to cheer her up
I wish her son's love was enough
I tell her, "Mama, go to sleep"
She tell me "Boy, hush. You better pray to God you never get your heart crushed"
I shake my head in frustration
Head to my room and I can still hear the tunes with my door shut
Fuck it though, a couple more months I'll be gone
Off to college and dorms
Foolin' myself, thinkin' problems are gone
But now it's 1 AM and my mama dialin' my phone
I know she intoxicated and soon this high that I'm on comes crashin' down
She lit, talkin' drunk shit, I'm pissed
But I'm still all ears like Basset Hounds
Thinkin' to myself, "Maybe my mama need help
Don't she got work in the morning?
Why she do this to herself?
Hate how she slurrin' her words
Soundin' so fuckin' absurd
This ain't the woman I know, why I just sit and observe?
Why don't I say how I feel?
When I do, she's defensive for real
Well maybe things get better with time, I heard it heals
Little did I know how deep her sadness would go
Lookin' back, I wish I woulda did more instead of runnin'
[Outro]
Something's got a hold on me
I can't let it go
Out of fear I won't be free
Something's got a hold on me
I can't let it go
Out of fear I won't be—
No!
Something's got a hold on me
I can't let it go

Life can bring much pain
There are many ways to deal with this pain (right)

I wrote this shit to talk about the word addiction
To my niggas --- I hope you listening
--- and ---, I hope you listening
This is for the whole fucking Ville, I hope you're listening
Smoking medical grade, but I ain't got prescription
All the way in Cali where they ain't got precipi-
-tation, feeling like the only one that made it
And I hate it for my niggas 'cause they ain't got ambition
Fuck did you expect, you can blame it on condition
Blame it on crack, you can blame it on the system
Blame it on the fact that 12 got jurisdiction
To ride around in neighborhoods that they ain't ever lived in
Blame it on the strain that you feel when daddy missing
Blame it on Trump shit, blame it on Clinton
Blame it on trap music and the politicians
Or the fact that every black boy wanna be Pippen
But they only got 12 slots on the Pistons
Blame it on the rain, Milli Vanilli with the disk skip
What I'm tryna say is the blame can go deep as seas
Just to blame 'em all I would need like twenty CD's
There's all sorts of trauma from drama that children see
Type of shit that normally would call for therapy
But you know just how it go in our community
Keep that shit inside it don't matter how hard it be
Fast forward, them kids is grown and they blowing trees
And popping pills due to chronic anxiety
I been saw the problem but stay silent 'cause I ain't Jesus
This ain't no trial if you desire go higher please
But fuck that now I'm older I love you 'cause you my friend
Without the drugs I want you be comfortable in your skin
I know you so I know you still keep a lot of shit in
You running from yourself and you buying product again
I know you say it helps and no I'm not trying to offend
But I know depression and drug addiction don't blend
Reality distorts and then you get lost in the wind
And I done seen the combo take niggas off the deep end
One thing about your demons they bound to catch up one day
I'd rather see you stand up and face them than run away
I understand this message is not the coolest to say
But if you down to try it I know of a better way

One night
When me and my mom was about to go to bed
All the doors was locked
Then when I had fell asleep
My mom had heard three gun shots
It was to my cousin, his name was Rod
The one that came to pick me up
He had been shot right through the face, right in the neck
And he got shot right in the stomach
[Chorus]
I put my hand to the sky, I sing
Grateful for the blessings you bring
Thank you for the ones I love
Forgive me for the times I was
Down and confused, I know
What I reap is what I will sow
Once again I find myself
Back with you from my hell
All I ever wanted was to hear them bitches holler back
Get some money plus respect and now look, I got all of that
All I wanna do is see my granny on the other side
All I wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry
All I wanna do is touch a platinum plaque and celebrate
All I wanna do is keep my niggas out the yellow tape
All I wanna do is see my granny on the other side
All I wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry

[Verse]
Right now I'm starin' out the window of my Range and contemplating, am I sane?
Have I sacrificed for fame?
My occupation's on my brain
Thought that I could change it all if I had change
But the niggas that I came up with way back is still the same
I be tryna give 'em game like Santa did when Christmas came
They be listenin' but it's clear to me they did not hear a thing
It go in one ear and out the other like a bullet out the muzzle of a pistol shot by brothers standin' point-blank range
Niggas bang in the Ville, I always thought that shit was strange
How you claim blood or cuz when that was just a LA thing?
I don't mean no disrespect towards your set, no, I'm just sayin'
That it seem like for acceptance niggas will do anything
Niggas will rep any gang, niggas will bust any head
Niggas will risk everything, point him out and then he dead
Shootin' up where his granny live, "blaow, blaow!", his granny duck
He don't give a fuck, he's on Henny and Xanny'd up
Blowin' Tammy up, bitch, when you gon' give them panties up?
He gon' plant a seed, but best believe he ain't man enough
Just because yo' dick can spray semen, it don't mean that you ready to let go of yo' childish ways
The results are deadly
Because that child will suffer and that's what can most affect me
The little girl I met this past summer said, "Don't forget me"
I won't forget you, how could I with all you went through?
A bullet hit yo' cousin in Temple while he was with you
And while you was talkin', I was tearin' up, where's the tissue?
If you was my sister then I would kiss you and tell you that I'm sorry for the pain you had to live through
I know I'm blessed because yo' stress is realer than anything I done been through
[Chorus]
I put my hand to the sky, I sing
Grateful for the blessings you bring
Thank you for the ones I love
Forgive me for the times I was
Down and confused, I know
What I reap is what I will sow
Once again I find myself
Back with you from my hell
All I ever wanted was to hear them bitches holler back
Get some money plus respect and now look, I got all of that
All I wanna do is see my granny on the other side
All I wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry
All I wanna do is touch a platinum plaque and celebrate

All I wanna do is see my granny on the other side
All I wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry
[Outro]
It's not that big
Well at least, um
God had saved him 'cause he still alive
So why do y'all think that bad stuff happen?
Like why can't the world just be all nice things?
Because God is tryna, um
Warn-warn us or teach us a lesson that we need to learn
Or He's tryna warn us of He's comin' back to, um, see us and take us home and redo the world
He's comin' back to, um, have us be His children and for us to see Him for the first time so we can rejoice with Him and have our time
And after we do that, He's gonna restart the world

33 years, damn, I'm grateful I survived
We wasn't s'posed to get past 25
Joke's on you motherfucker, we alive
All these niggas popping now is young
Everybody say the music that they make is dumb
I remember I was 18
Money, pussy, parties, I was on the same thing
You gotta give a boy a chance to grow some
Everybody talkin' like they know somethin' these days
Niggas actin' woke, but they broke, umm
I respect the struggle but you all frontin' these days
Man, they barely old enough to drive
To tell them what they should do, who the fuck am I?
I heard one of 'em dissed me, I'm surprised
I ain't trippin', listen good to my reply
Come here lil' man, let me talk with ya
See if I can paint for you the large picture
Congrats 'cause you made it out your mama house
I hope you make enough to buy your mom a house
I see your watch icy and your whip foreign
I got some good advice, never quit tourin'
'Cause that's the way we eat here in this rap game
I'm fuckin' with your funky lil' rap name
I hear your music and I know that rap's changed
A bunch of folks would say that that's a bad thing
'Cause everything's commercial and it's pop now
Trap drums is the shit that's hot now
See, I've been on a quest for the next wave
But never mind, that was just a segue
I must say, by your songs I'm unimpressed, hey
But I love to see a Black man get paid
And plus, you havin' fun and I respect that
But have you ever thought about your impact?
These white kids love that you don't give a fuck
'Cause that's exactly what's expected when your skin black
They wanna see you dab, they wanna see you pop a pill
They wanna see you tatted from your face to your heels
And somewhere deep down, fuck it, I gotta keep it real
They wanna be black and think your song is how it feels
So when you turn up, you see them turnin' up too
You hit the next city, collect your money when it's due
You gettin' that paper, swimmin' in bitches, I don't blame you
You ain't thinkin' 'bout the people that's lookin' like me and you
True, you got better shit to do
You coulda bought a crib with all that bread that you done blew
I know you think this type of revenue is never endin'
But I wanna take a minute just to tell you that ain't true
One day, them kids that's listening gon' grow up
And get too old for that shit that made you blow up
Now your show's lookin' light cause they don't show up
Which unfortunately means the money slow up
Now you scramblin' and hopin' to get hot again
But you forgot you only popped 'cause you was ridin' trends
Now you old news and you goin' through regrets
'Cause you never bought that house, but you got a Benz
And a bunch of jewels and a bunch of shoes
And a bunch of fake friends, I ain't judgin' you
I'm just tellin' you what's probably gon' happen when you rappin'
'Bout the type of shit you rappin' 'bout
It's a faster route to the bottom
I wish you good luck
I'm hoping for your sake that you ain't dumb as you look
But if it's really true what people sayin'
And you call yourself playin' with my name
Then I really know you fucked, trust
I'll be around forever 'cause my skills is tip-top
To any amateur niggas that wanna get rocked
Just remember what I told you when your shit flop

Yeah, ahem
Hey, yeah

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Partially functional, half of me is comfortable
The other half is close to the cliff, like Mrs. Huxtable
These boys got them holsters and clips they pack like Lunchables
Like white boys in grade school, while we ate school-made food
Just eyeing they shit, wish I was trying they shit
Knowing when mama hit the store, she wasn’t buying that shit
No, I ain't crying a bit, man that's just life, that's how that shit work
You reach your hand in fire, you pull it back when you get burnt
Gotta learn when you get hurt, even if it's with Cupid
He beat you and you went back, you's officially stupid
Oh yeah, I understand, that's your man, you had a plan
You been together for some years, you sticking with him for the kids
So you overlook the tears, but we both know that's a bad look
'Cause 20 years from now, your daughter'll probably get her ass whooped
Look, if this too deep for the intro, I’ll find another use
But just in case it's perfect, let me introduce, Cole
[Chorus: Erykah Badu & J. Cole]
Time to save the world
Where in the world is all the time?
So many things I still don't know (Uh-uh, hey)
So many times I've changed my mind
Guess I was born to make mistakes
But I ain't scared to take the weight
So when I stumble off the path (Yeah)
I know my heart will guide me back (Yeah)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Man, is this too deep for the intro? If so, I’ll find another use
But just in case it's perfect, let me introduce
It’s Cole, I had a dream and so I made a move
A ill ass nigga who just so happened to stay in school
Still rap for hustlers and motherfuckers that hated school
Said, "That's for busters," then heard my shit and I made it cool
It's safe to say that I’m gifted as if I’m Christmas shopping
I got gangsta niggas lining up in admissions office
Ayy, possibly 'cause all the hoes a nigga scraped
A lot of shit up on my plate, so you know a nigga late
To my first class, I’d much rather sit up in first class
Should I admit that a slutty bitch was my first smash?
Wasn't experienced, so nah, I didn't wear it out
Always thought my first time would be someone I cared about
But being a virgin was something to be embarrassed 'bout
I used that ass for practice, so I wasn't scared out my mind
You call it rhymes, I call it clearing out my mind
Was just a young boy staring out my blinds
'Til I got free from my mama leash
Running loose through the streets like a stray dog in heat
And we looking for some freaks, can you play? Pardon me
What's your name? Don’t mistake me for no lame, no, not me
She knew I was on the team 'cause she seen how tall I be
In the club dappin’ niggas, eventually, R.I.P
Damn, you win some, you lose some, that's just how it happens
And if a nigga step up to you, then you gotta scrap 'em
Your name is all you got, throwing hands by the bathroom
It's funny, I barely told nobody I started rapping
'Cause see, some niggas was haters that I just viewed as clowns
At fourteen, I knew I was the nicest dude around
I gotta make a move, I gotta do this now
If they don’t know your dreams, then they can't shoot 'em down

Boy, you know my L's dirty, if they stop me, I'm goin' to jail surely
I’ll be next to my brother in the cell, no bail for me

And all I gotta do is call once and she there all ready

One day you tryna make rent, next day you in jail
Lord knows he meant well
So I take the pencil and write like a pen pal
Some shit that’s darker than the tints up on the windshield

That boy in class embarrassed because he broke
Hopin’ today he won’t be the butt of somebody’s joke
See me I lived it all from dirt-poor in a trailer
Worried about my mother and never trustin' my neighbors
To middle-class with a backyard and my own room
To bein’ the only black kid in my homeroom
Academically gifted and followed my own rules
Was runnin' the streets, hey ma, I’ll be home soon
Was out chasin' hoes, was out hoopin'

Letter to the ghetto, hold your head high
You can pick apart my raps, I ain’t told ya nan lie

Go on look for a better nigga, girl you can’t find
Fine young man with an old man mind
No time for the chick who fucked the whole mankind
Aw, no ma'am, I’m an old land mine
I been waiting to blow up for a long damn time
Now I’m armed and I’m, Fayettenam’s finest
Carolina’s savior, marijuana blazer
Only on occasion 'cause my mind be racin'
Lost in my thoughts so my eyes be Asian
Thinking how these rap niggas gotta be fakin'
Whole style obviously copied, pasted
Plagiarized swag, may arrive last
But when it’s all said and done, I’ma be ahead of them
Way that I describe it, prescribe a nigga medicine
What that I be fly, I be higher than the Jet-a-sons
Moving on up, nigga higher than the Jeffersons
All about the Benjamins, bad chicks, send 'em in
Basic hoes, toss 'em out, can’t even get Waffle House
Hatin’ niggas, chalk 'em out, go on, get the coffin out

Get a whole lot of you know and she bald like an Eagle
No, not on top but down there
She say she want to hop on top, girl, I don’t care
You better get yours 'fore I reach mine cause then I’m throwing peace signs
If you a freak, I can take you to your peak
Girl, I do it to the maximum, Nissan
And I hope you a believer
I’m quarterbacking, tryna get you open like receivers
Far from an overnight achiever
Cole is like the leader of the new niggas
To tell the truth, I’m only fucking with a few niggas
If that, the rest of y'all niggas get lapped
I sit back and reflect on the rap game, I came from out of nowhere
Nigga, I swear them lames ain’t know how to prepare
Got niggas shouting out the 'Ville, "I gotta go there”
Boy don’t you know you get shot over there?
I say my prayers 'cause this life ain’t fair
A bunch of backstabbing niggas, hope the knife ain’t there
A bunch of temptation facing when your wife ain’t there
Yeah late at night, when I got the phone call and made a right
But my crib was straight ahead, shawty gave me head
Hit it then I quit it ‘fore she even made the bed
Damn I’m no good, but damn it’s so good
I’m picturing that body like a camera phone would
Something like Rihanna while I’m up in that V-gina
Type of chick that only dress in something that’s designer
I could give a fuck long as there’s something that’s behind of her
Got the type of bumper make a dog wanna hump
Back to the topic, actually forgot it
Hoes, money, I’m the shit, oh yeah, I’m reminded
The way I put the words together, cleverly align 'em
These other rap niggas should never be a problem

And I’m ghost, nigga, yeah

[Hook: J. Cole]
Ay, one time (One time) one time (One time)
Ay, throw your hands to the sky tonight
'Cause I think I see the baddest little thing in the world right now
But I gotta make sure I’m right, and girl you dead right
If your head right, I’ll be there every night
I just might change your life
'Cause baby you got it (You got it) you got it (You got it)
You got it (You got it) you got it (You got it, hey)
[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Hey, Cole World, real cold world
I watch you hit the floor and watch it drop it real low, girl
Last time I seen you, you was a lil old girl
Had a crush, now we grown and you still so thorough
Uh, clap for her, work it 'til you exhausted
I swear ain't nothing worse than a bad bitch that lost it
Brains off the chain, smart mouth with a dumb ass
Goddamn, your ex-man is a dumbass
When you was leaving, did he put up a fight?
Was he stressing you? Wasn’t fucking you right?
Well, one man’s trash is another man’s treasure
One man’s pain is another man’s pleasure
One damn thing you can’t change is the weather
But even if it rain, we get rained on together, huh
It’s whatever, you shine, I shine
I know you got a 9 to 5, I’ll be your 5 to 9

[Hook: J. Cole]
Ay, one time (One time) one time (One time)
Ay, throw your hands to the sky tonight

Yeah, go 'head and pop it like you do in the mirror
I’m picking through the crowd, tryna see a little clearer
High heel wearer, uh, hell of a body
First one to spot you and I ain't telling nobody
Nope, I’m peeking at your ass, winking at your ass
If I don't bag, I’ll be thinking 'bout your ass
For the whole week, no time for cold feet
She too bad to pass, so fine, I'm gon' speak
I tell her my name Jermaine, I’m tryna be lowkey
She tell me I got that flame, "Your rhymes are so deep"
Damn, girl thank you, shit, you so bad
Know your daddy wish he could still spank you, hol' up
'Fore these other niggas roll up and try and get ya
The ones that say they riders but never do ride with ya
I’m tryna vibe wit'cha so won't you throw me your phone number?
And let them lames get your old number

Look, Cole World, still a cold world
And a couple y'all is cool but we a little more thorough, huh
Whole time, a little more girls
You know I spit that sick shit and there’s still no cure
Hold up, loud packs like I got cancer
Choking on them white boys make a Black Panther
Love my women with high heels and high standards
And only cheat on my broad if I run out of answers
I got that vicious flow, Moncler winter coat
I ain't superstitious, I make all these broads split my pole
Ha, you dig it, this shit ain't for beginners
I’m something like a fetus, see, I'm not quite kidding
And there's something you ain't seeing like I block y'all vision
Like my Remy with no juice, you a lot like Bishop
Hundred K in twenty-two hours
See, money talks, you muthafuckers is Boomhauer
No check back, in debt, yep
Loud in my J, y'all smoke that Gallaudet
Higher than I need to be, flyer 'cause I need to be
Love our conversation but it’s late right now, I need to beat, haha
One time for the Ville that Cole rep
Another time for the city of the slow death
I don't understand why these niggas so vexed
I don't need no chains with no cross to know I’m blessed
Hold up!

Yeah, hey

[Verse]
To the college kids, no scholarships, starting your semester
Unpacking your suitcases filling up your dresser
Enjoy it while you got it, after that, it’s God bless ya
Life is your professor, know that bitch is gon' test ya
I got some shit I’d like to get off my chest
I spill out my soul, I spit out my stress
And can I spit out my stress?
It’s the feeling in the air
You bout to drop a real classic
He said, "Cole, a lil' birdy told me on the low you got a Illmatic”
Nobody touching Nas, nigga it’s more like Villematic
Uh, these Fayettenam tales be paying off well
What story is my audio theater gon' tell
I know my debut will ship, but is it gon' sell?
I guess it’s in God’s hands
I make the type of pieces that make Jesus say, "God damn"
That's for your non-believers, I’m the truth, only time'll teach ya
And fuck the haters, probably never love they mamas neither
Old bitter-ass sit around in middle class homes
With computers on hatin' on the newest song
While you was browsin', I was takin' out them student loans
Tryna do this shit better than the niggas we grew up on
Name a fuckin' song I ain't threw up on
Talk is cheap, it's like y'all grew up in a Jewish home
Hah, pardon the stereotype
But y'all giving me mixed feelings like I married a white woman
One minute I’m overrated, next minute I’m the savior
You hate it before you played it, I already forgave ya
For bullshitting, and that nigga Cole spitting that real
Wrote this line on a plane got flown straight from the Ville
To Miami, where the same time last year
I was broker than you, I just wanna make that clear
'Cause now I’m dealing with money I’ve never seen before
And R&B bitches want me, that was just dreams before
Now do I give into the temptation I’m facing?
The thought of losing a good woman keep me from chasing
But I’m just a man, at time’s the timing is wrong
Plus my dick is like a man with a mind of it’s own
But I’m tryna be strong, remind myself she ain’t about shit
These hoes the same, all that change is the outfit
Looking for cheese on some mouse shit
Suck a nigga, fuck a nigga, then go run they mouth quick
Rappers took a vacation I came over to house sit
You want change, this that between the seats in your couch shit
The fuck you thought, I lost it?
All that flame on my name would get exhausted
Au contraire, my nigga, they all ears
Sit back, enjoy the ride it’s finna be a long year, yeah
It’s finna be a long year, yeah
[Outro]
I know you feel that
The tingle in your spine, don’t conceal that
Don’t conceal that
This exactly what you thought, somebody bought the real back
Hey15Embed Enchanted Lyrics[Intro: J. Cole]
Yeah, this is where the

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, this is where the fathers ain't livin', least not with us
Might see 'em round the city and won’t even say wassup
When niggas play tough, won't even smile in mirrors
And we learn to fuck hoes off trial and error
Just a small town nigga, big city hustle
Glued to the TV, Jigga, Diddy, Russell
These were our heroes, strictly for them zeros
For that Robert De Niro, niggas reload on them kilos, uh
Dodgin them people, mad at myself 'cause
I done seen some things that I’d rather not tell
Shawty smoke crack and her boyfriend too
And sometimes, he touch her daughter how them boyfriends do
Pull up to the club where my boys went too
See that yellow tape and the boys in blue
A nigga on a stretcher, and though I never met you
I'm thinkin', "God bless you, the city tryna get you"
[Bridge: J Cole]
Man, don’t let the city get you
Fuck the horoscopes, know the ropes like a wrestler
If them bullets wet you, bet your mama need a tissue
Your face on the front of our shirts, screaming, "We miss you"

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Come with me
Run quick see
What do we have here now? Do you wanna ride or die?
Da da-da-da, da da da da
Come with me (Da-da, da-da, da-da)
Run quick see (Da-da da-da da-da)
What do we have here now? Do you wanna ride or die?
Da da-da-da, da da da da

[Verse 2: Omen]
Yeah, now see God, I know you only do what's best for me
But is it cool if we negotiate my destiny?
They always tellin’ me it’s temporary
Then why it's feelin' like a cemetery? My dreams ain't got no obituaries
My city hurtin' and none of us well-equipped here
You heard me say I was ballin’, I probably meant tears
I’m tryna get clear
I’m tryna quit fear, who wrote the scripts here?
These kids live their whole life just killing time
Running the race with no finish line
They tryna noose us with they ropes, but I'm finna climb
I think my foolish pride might become my suicide
But I ain't tryna go, no, baby
And through these lines and quotes you gotta find some hope
'Cause I ain't dying, my words gon’ last forever
You can hold the treasure, look inside, see a diamond in my mind
I'm tired of seeing dope fiends wiping they nose clean
Is my neighborhood just a smokescreen?
I think I'm in the dungeon fam, I see low green
Sons raised by both queens but it's no kings
[Chorus: J. Cole]
Come with me
Run quick see
What do we have here now? Do you wanna ride or die?
Da da-da-da, da da da da
Come with me (Da-da, da-da, da-da)
Run quick see (Da-da da-da da-da)
What do we have here now? Do you wanna ride or die?
Da da-da-da, da da da da

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
It seems like niggas either feel you or they tryna kill you
I face the sky and hope that God ain't acting unfamiliar
You play whatever cards he deal no matter how peculiar
They tell me that it's God’s will, I’m asking "God, will ya
Heal a nigga from all this pain?" Mama smokin' cocaine
As it rains out, am I to blame? Try to stay sane
So I came outside where they rock with them thangs out
To clear my mind, the same time they blew that boy brains out
But will it change? It's like niggas is free
But our minds still in the chains, brothers killing each other
The blood spill, it's a shame, will it ever slow up?
A lot of niggas getting older, but they never grow up
And do they sons like they fathers did and never show up
No need to cry about it, just another episode of
Life, watch the whole season, nigga, no reruns
The devil out here buying souls, nigga, no refunds, huh
[Bridge: J. Cole]
Man, don’t let the city get you
Fuck the horoscopes, know the ropes like a wrestler
If them bullets wet you, bet your mama need a tissue
Your face on the front of our shirts screaming, "We miss you"

[Outro: J. Cole]
Another day, another song
A mother prays, another gone
But still we play, like ain't nothing wrong
Like ain't nothing wrong, 'cause ain't nothing wrong
I'm not as fast, I’m not as tall
But before I pass, I gotta ball
I gotta ball, I gotta ball
Nigga, I gotta ball13Embed Blow Up Lyrics[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Huh, uh, now don’t it sound legendary?
Live enough to resurrect the dead and buried
This for niggas who ain't satisfied with secondary
This for my sisters who ain't satisfied with secretary
Uh, I’m blowing up, and bitch, I’m still me
But what's the cost to live your dream, do you feel me?
Everything glittering ain't what you think it will be
Funny how money, chains and whips make me feel free
I’m starring in this bitch, and yeah, I write the show
Fuck the haters, I’m headed to the place you like to go
They say, "What you fighting for?" The game is on life support
And Gary Coleman just passed, life is short

[Pre-Chorus]
Bitch I’m about to blow up
Look I’m about to blow up
Yeah, got to the club early
Just to get in free and wait for hoes to show up

Mama say I should reconsider law school
That means I wear a suit and bend the truth and feel awful
Hell naw, got a degree, but what that cost you?
You make a good salary just to pay Sally Mae
That's real as ever, ducking bill collectors like Jehovah’s witness
When they showed up at your door at Christmas
Was broke as dishes, tryna let it go
Hit the club, she drop it low, lower than my credit score
Account overdraft, what I got this debit for?
So much debt, it got me drinking, thinking "Bitch I better blow"
I better blow, these hoes ain't checking
For no nigga with no vehicle, you border like Mexico
Heh, hey baby girl, what it look like?
And where ya head at? And what ya cook like?
She said, "Where your bread at? Or what your whip like?
You ain't got one or the other, well brother, good night"

Praise God, it’s hard to stay spiritual
How they got these niggas on the TV selling miracles?
You mean to tell me everything goin be fine
If I call your hotline and pay $29.99? (Shit)
Well damn, why ain't you say so?
Take this check and ask God to multiply all my pesos
And erase my number out the phones of these fake hoes
I saved her number just in case but now it’s case closed
To you niggas biting my flows and my subject matter
You’ll never be me partner so it don’t fuckin' matter
You try to be and your career will see funerals
And be you, that's when it sounds beautiful
Then maybe you can blow up
And maybe you can blow up

You look sweet enough to make a nigga need a filling
If you got a man, do that nigga need a fill-in?
She said, "Looks kill and I’m tryna make a killin'"
And God willing, I’d be chilling on the boat nigga
Love is a gamble, I ain’t dealin’ with no broke nigga
Down in Miami with a super ho team
Tryna bag a brother with a Super Bowl ring
Oh, she down in Dallas at the All-Star game
Spittin’ All-Star game
Tryna get a nigga with a all-star name, somethin’ like James
Somethin like Wade, if you something like paid
You can fuck tonight, yeah, she sayin', "Fuck some nice J's
What about your life savings?" Won’t spend her life slavin’
So she graduated, rich nigga wife training
And if you got money, man the head is amazing

You got your mean little walk with the model pose
You got your hair did, you got designer clothes

Hey, I get bored so fast that they won’t last
But girl you’re special like I met you in the slow class
'Cause yo ass got me fiending for ya so far
My life is like a movie, would you be my co-star?
Like Halle Berry? Your old nigga act like a bitch, like Tyler Perry
You caught him down in Memphis cheating like Calipari
I see you like to stay up on your ESPN
If your mind is on sex, you must got ESP then
Had a crush on way back, I wasn’t VIP then
But I was plotting on you, I really wish that I'd have got to know you
Before we grew up and I blew up with these Benjamins
That way I know for sure your love is really genuine
Is you my homie? Well show me what kind of friend you is
What if it's phony? Yeah only 'cause I can give you ends

You fine as hell
I guess I met you for a reason, only time can tell
But well, I'm wonderin' what type of shit you wantin'
Do you like the finer things or you a simple woman?
Would you drink with a nigga? Do you smoke weed?
Don't be ashamed, it ain't no thing, I used to blow trees
Gettin' lifted, I quit but shit, I might get high with you
It's only fittin' 'cause I'm lookin' super fly with you
A flower, you are powerful, you do somethin' to me
'Cause girl, I caught the vibe like you threw somethin' to me
So I threw 'em back, now all my niggas hollerin', “Who was that?”
“Oh boy, she bad nigga, what you 'bout to do with that?”
I'm finna take you home, just sip a little Patron
Now we zonin', baby you so fine

I'm tryna make the goosebumps on your inner thigh show
I'll let you beat me there as far as finish lines go
Yeah, and if you gotta leave for work
I'll be right here in the same bed that you left me in
I love thick women 'cause my aunt she rode equestrian
I used to go to the stables and get them kids to bet me
And I would always ride the stallions whenever she let me
I'm jokin', I mean that thing is pokin'
I mean you kinda like that girl that's in the US Open
I mean I got this hidden agenda that you provokin'
I got bath water that you can soak in, things I could do with lotion
Don't need a towel, we could dry off in the covers
And when you think you like it, I promise you gonna love it
Yeah, when lights comin' through the drapes and we both yawnin'

God bless the woman that can hold Patron
God bless her homegirl that drove us home

Therefore you shouldn't judge a nigga off the shit that you hear
Get all defensive, apprehensive, all because my career
To be fair, I know we barely know each other and yeah
Somehow I wound up in your bed so where we headed from here?
Just say you're scared if you're scared
But if you through frontin', we can do somethin'
And you know just what I'm talkin' about

[Intro]
Hey, I got a dollar and a dream
It's all a nigga got so it's about that green
And I'm all up in that spot, hey

[Verse 1]
Yeah, the mental state of a young black genius conflicted
The fast life I done seen on the screen is addictive
Money and clothes I done dreamed about
And all the hoes that I fiend about
Ay, tell me am I wrong for visualizing material shit I never had?
Waving gats instead of flags, the American Dream
Why do we cling to the villains, knowing they kill 'em?
My niggas high enough to swing from the ceiling
Ink from the pen spilling on my notebook
Filled with dreams, this is my hope book
Still the screams from little girls shot and killed fill my head on the daily
At times I question God, can you blame me? They can’t tame me
My voice screech through the streets, I'm a beast on 'em
Oh no, he will not fold, you will not see a crease on him
He will not slip or lose his grip, they got them cleats on him
But never will he run unless you call police on him
[Chorus]
One time, two times, three times
Sometimes I scrap, sometimes I'm throwin' up the peace sign
It's two sides to a nigga though
I said it's two sides to a nigga, yo
Ay look, sometimes I'm feeling high then I'm feeling low
Lord, will I die? Will I survive? Let a nigga know
You say you know me but what side did you get to know?
It's two sides to a nigga, yo, yo, yo

[Verse 2]
Yeah, some pussy niggas pulled out on me and my mans
Wasn’t for the pistol, we drop 'em right where he stands
But still we never ran, foolish pride made us stand right there
Not understanding we could lose our life there
And then it hit us, thinking 'bout the close calls from long distance
Uh, as lil niggas in the 'Ville, we was trippin
Type of nosy ass niggas to watch the fight until it's over
They ran when the gats came out, I moved closer
Foolish, what was I thinking? Wasn’t trying to be cool, it's
Just the thrill of the danger, get so filled up with anger
When a stranger get to violating
He sleeping on me wide awake, bitch I'll annihilate him
I'm tired of waiting on my ticket out this muh'fucker
Hope they don’t kill me before I get up out this muh'fucker
I gotta go, now can I be that nigga I thought I was? I gotta know
Will I make it like I thought I would? I gotta blow
[Chorus]
One time, two times, three times
Sometimes I scrap, sometimes I'm throwin' up the peace sign
It's two sides to a nigga though
I said it's two sides to a nigga, yo
Ay look, sometimes I'm feeling high then I'm feeling low
Lord, will I die? Will I survive? Let a nigga know
You say you know me but what side did you get to know?
It's two sides to a nigga, yo, yo, yo

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I seen Heaven, seen Hell, the two faces of the Ville
One side dreams, the other side's real
One side schemes, the other side deals
What the pain brings, another mother cry still
Why the fuck am I here, God?
That nigga died, why the fuck am I still alive?
I feel ashamed 'cause the good Lord done brought all this success to me
And all I seem to focus on is all this stress on me
Blessed homie, we breathin', cold world got me sneezing
Wrote this when I was broke, so hey, I guess we even
Throwin' blows, fighting demons, tryna stop from bustin' semen
In an unfamiliar bitch, I know my niggas feel this shit
How could I fuck her raw? And I just met the ho
My dick took over, it ain't never felt this wet before
I'm stressing in my mind but its way to late to stop it
Make this shit so bad, I had a condom in my pocket
Lets change the topic, before I go berserk, I’m so alert
Riding down 95, nah, I ain't finna to go to work
I’m headed back home, ain't staying that long
I’m chasing dreams shawty, I'm paying back loans
I’m paying dues that a nigga paying tax on
I'm tryna blow like a nigga playing saxophone
I'm playing daddy to another nigga daughter
Don’t worry, even Jesus never saw his real father
It don’t bother me at all though
Yeah, say it don’t bother me at all
They got me thinking 'bout my mom though
Man, I can't wait to sing this song
I'll be like, I'll be like
[Outro]
Hey, don’t cry, hey, oh no
'Cause we ain't gotta worry 'bout the money no more
We ain't gotta worry 'bout how the bills get paid
We ain't gotta worry how the meals get fed
Don’t cry, hey, oh no
'Cause we ain't gotta worry 'bout the money no more
We ain't gotta worry 'bout how them bills get paid
We ain't gotta worry how the meals get fed

Just turn the beat down just a little bit
Hey, yeah

[Verse 1]
They say anything's possible
You gotta dream like you never seen obstacles
Chasing obscene profits so we ain’t stopping for the red lights
Look in my rearview, all I see is niggas' headlights
Catch me if you can ho, they try and sack me and I scramble
Look up in the sky you’ll see exactly where I am bo
Hey, don’t you see me man?
Making my wishes come true with no genie man
I got the keys to my beamer with no Beenie Man
I’m on these rich niggas' ass, no bikini man
I bring the real to the day the Lord free me man
Never imagined that the kids would want to be me man
Ay, could it be I give the hopeless broke kids hope?
Caught me walking through the mall, looking like he seen a ghost
Simply had to approach, "What's up youngblood?"
Ay, ain't it strange?
A year ago today, my nigga, I was counting change
Yeah, hopping trains up in New York City
Know I gotta thank God, 'cause if you weren’t with me
Then I surely woulda died, you can throw the fork in me
This my New Year's resolution, dawg, no more pork in me
Uh, I ain't no Muslim though
Caron Butler, I’m a wizard if ya doesn't know
It's Young Simba, yeah, I’m ballin’ 'til the buzzer blow
You's tryna kick the shit I kick, man you gon' stub your toe
Boy that's just how tough I go, see this is my light work
This shit y'all callin' classic, I be like, "That might work"
Want you to feel something new, that's how a dyke work
They ask me 'bout pressure, they want to see my pipe burst
[Interlude]
Not tonight nigga
Ay, not tonight nigga
Yeah, hey
Man, man, hey

[Verse 2]
Man, I rap so vicious but I talk so politely
Never met a baby momma momma who don’t like me
Met a couple baby fathers though that wanna fight me
I hit it 'til she snooze like the news nigga, nightly
Send her back to you when she no longer excites me
Now she bitter with this nigga 'cause he ain't quite me
One thing's for certain baby girl, you are a wifey
Two things for fucking sure, I am not the husband though
So run back to him while you still can
He sticking with his wife and kid, yeah, that's a real man
I was ashamed all along and I still am
We let the lust interrupt something real, damn
Well girl we grown so you gotta play your own position
I wouldn’t say that you a ho, just made a ho decision
And you can blame it on the liquor like a prohibition
We both know that's what you wanted girl, I know you listenin'

[Interlude]
Hey
Girl, I know you listenin'
Uh, I know you listenin'
Hey, yeah
[Verse 3]
Shoutout to the bootleggers who supply my shit
The fans online tryna find my shit
And to them niggas listening but won't buy my shit
Then catch me in the street and wanna ride my dick
Y’all niggas is the worst, see me
Like, "J. Cole homie, could you sign my burnt CD?"
Nigga please, a album ten dollars, you act like it’s ten Gs
This food for thought cost the same as two No. 3s
So at ease with that broke shit
We all tryna get a dollar boy, no shit
You know I feel your pain, therefore I slang this hope shit
And give you lines that you rewind and think, "Oh shit"
These rappers talk a lot of money, cars and hoes shit
I give you that and then a whole lot more shit
That "got rich and still rapping like I’m poor" shit
You niggas think you know shit, man you don’t know shit

[Outro]
Ho bitch
Yeah, Cole, bitch
Uh, J. Cole, nigga

I see your homegirl tryna sway you
How you figure I would play you
Would you look at that?
The same one that caught her nigga with some freak
All in her sheets left for a week
Then what she do? Double back

But I feel like this is worth it, do you disagree with that?
If not then holla back
Hey and tell ya girl you’ll call her back

Now, now, now, now, know we be arguing
But ain't you riding with me?
We breaking, up we making up
Like Dwayne Wayne and Whitley
You throw things, you broke things
Use both hands and hit me
And right when you call the law
I’ll tell my boy to come get me
Then you, then you start listening
To friends, and then it gets tricky
They try to tell you leave, but this love is real sticky
So you ignore the hickeys, the pics of chicks in they vicky’s
That they sent me, is that real love
You’re the only one that I will love
Damn, damn
[Bridge]
My best friend says
I can stay with her
At her house, no doubt, anytime I like
My best friend says
Don't let you in my life cause you don't do for me and you don't act right
My best friend says
If she was me, she would let you go a long, long time ago
My best friend says, my best friend says

[Hook: J. Cole, Aaliyah, & Missy Elliot]

Just one of them days, a nigga feel like flossin’
A Stone Cold Stunner, bitch, I'm Steve Austin
Cool as Drew Brees, I’m blowin' a few Gs
Just to hear them hoes say he’s awesome
He’s awful, yeah remember when ya fronted on me
Pulled up beside me in that big body and stunted on me
Or when the bouncer just announced that it was bottle service only
Then he kicked me out the line, yeah he punted on me
Well look, I’m back, bitch, back with an attitude
Buyin' out the bar, 'cause I feel like this the shit I gotta prove
Last year the cashier told me my card was not approved
Now I’m tippin' the server a hundred to show my gratitude
Easy, told you I’d be back baby, I guess you ain't believe me
Now I’m living just like the niggas you see on TV
VIP feel like this club oughta thank me
I hit the bar so y’all can see me ballin’, HD

Knee deep in the game, my chain heavy
Somebody get the pilot and ask is the plane ready
To handle all the weight on my shoulders we takin' off
Don’t wanna meet Aaliyah but yet I can’t take it off
'Cause how I’m supposed to shine without the proper bling
Remember when I did a show with Waka Flocka Flame
Felt naked 'cause the boy rocked about a thousand chains
Guess we rock a lot of ice 'cause we got a lot of pain
Thats five hundred years of swellin', I’m tryna tell 'em
Jacob the Jeweler is cooler now that he a felon
Jay put a stamp on the nigga but wouldn’t mail him
If he couldn't sell him, so what that tell him, huh?
My chain heavy and my bitches look very thorough
Must be the money like Deion with the Jheri curl
White Range, call that motherfucka Larry Bird

Am I changing right before your eyes?
Becoming someone you don't recognize
As if I was disguised, I'm on that shit as if I was the flies
I'm touching skies, no puffing lye
Man these songs that I made in my bedroom and shit
Goin' finally give a nigga leg room in the whip
From a Civic to a seven must've died and went to heaven
Like a passenger on 9/11, please go find a reverend
You see I promised that I'd never change
But that was way before I made the dough and met the game
Say hello to Miss Thang, I forgot yo name, she yellow
And even white women want a nigga, Othello
I'm balling with nuggets, like fuck it I'm Carmelo
Now the crib got much rooms, Portobello
She drop it low and then she bust moves for the fellow
I sit your ass down like you was playing a cello
See, you niggas hated and I levitated further
Knew I would kill the game, premeditated murder
So if it comes down, may the best man win
No sweat like a headband then, nigga
[Chorus]
Where I'm from, if you ever seen what I seen
You know it can't get no better for me
No, it can't get no better for me
Where I'm from, if you ever seen what I seen
You know it can't get no better for me
No, it can't get no better for me

[Verse 2]
I'ma kill the game and invite witnesses
No death penalty, I'm giving life sentences
Like keep grinding boy, your life can change in one year
And even when it's dark out, the sun is shining somewhere
Yeah, look here I paid dues
My own worst enemy so fuck it, either way I can't lose
808's so my south niggas feel me
Light-skinned it so the house niggas feel me
She catch me creeping out your house she'll kill me
Is it worth for what's under that blouse?
My heart'll turn pitch black and cold if I split with my girl
If I could gift-wrap the globe, I would give you the world
But, do you love me like you used to?
Even though I ain't that nigga that you're used to
Remember back when I was broke? You would fix me
Do you prefer the broke me or the rich me?
The broke me couldn't buy you meals, not even a value meal
And now I pay for everything, how you feel?
Mixed feelings 'cause now all the chicks feeling him
You gotta adapt though, I'm never going back

Where I'm from, if you ever seen what I seen
Hey, you know it can't get no better for me
No, it can't get no better for me

Hey, this is the story of a youngin dreamin'
Left his city to see if he could be what he dreamin’
Big city on his own shit
But every now and then a nigga get homesick
Pick up the phone, holla at my partner he telling me, be warned
A lot of shit done changed in the time that you’ve been gone
Streets got meaner, the hoes got growner
And went and got babies the day they got they diplomas
Damn, gon’ be some niggas missing when you fly back
If you black, they sending you to jail or to Iraq
Old buddy that we hoop with, with the bad chick and a fly 'lac
And a gold chain? Caught him on the Merc, tryna buy crack
Damn homie! Shit, in high school you was the man homie
The fuck happened to you?
Used to beat niggas down at the buses after school
Now you looking like a motherfucking fool
[Chorus]
Said I’ll be home for the holidays
So when you see me, better holla at me
I gotta get up out this city ‘fore it try to trap me
I gotta leave, I wish I could stay
But I’ll be home for the holidays
And to those that I used to know
From way before, keep your head up
Come let's get this bread up
Girl, I gotta go, I wish I could stay
But I’m coming home for the holidays

[Verse 2]
Hey, this is a story bout some puppy love
But at the time boy, I was feeling like this must be love
Although now I'm on my grown shit
She bad as hell, a nigga still get home sick
I was fresh up off a scholarship
Dressed like a black man in college shit
Got a little knowledge now I’m following the politics
But I still gotta holla at my old chick
So sweet, so thick, girl pick up your phone, it’s me
She said “what, we ain't homies no more”
You go to college now you act like you don’t know me no more
Girl please, we got history, semester seem so long
The last time I seen ya baby you ain't have no clothes on
So if history repeats itself
When I get home, girl it's on, you ain't gon' need ya belt
Or your pants or your drawers, then we hit the rewind
Just don’t give it up in the meantime
[Chorus]
Said I’ll be home for the holidays
So when you see me, better holla at me
I gotta get up out this city ‘fore it try to trap me
I gotta leave, I wish I could stay

[Verse 3]
Man I reminisce on them school days
I know you know them act a fool days
That missed the bus then hit the blunt and go to school blazed
Trying to get laid so I gotta stay fly
But a nigga hella shy you would have thought that's where the Bulls play
Was just a freshman could used a little Kool-aid (cool aid)
Crushing on them upper classmen but it was too late
Buddy she was dating, yeah, he had the freshest shoes
But the nigga graduated and he never made two A’s
Hey if you’re listening, we got in school
But who will pay our tuition man?
These niggas crazy
One year cost about same as a Mercedes (benz)
Four years cost wife, crib, and a baby
Ay maybe this ain't for me
Only if I could be LeBron and go straight to league
The worst part of growing up man: shit just ain't for free
Maybe I can be somebody people pay to see
And maybe I should move up out here to the place to be
To get from A to Z, aye what you think I'm crazy
If I told you one day that I'ma sign with Jay-Z
And will I make it man I guess we gotta wait and see
[Chorus]
Said I’ll be home for the holidays
So when you see me, better holla at me
I gotta get up out this city ‘fore it try to trap me
I gotta leave, I wish I could stay

[Verse 1]
Hey, I know that this ain't nothing that you used to
Out of the ordinary, unusual
I know you had your whole life planned out
So to watch this pan out I know this shit gotta confuse you
I know you wonder why I had to choose you
Don't wanna take you for granted or abuse you
So I’ma keep it honest
I think it’s a little ironic
If I hit another chick its gonna bruise you
Shit, staring out the window of this plane
Thinking if it crash, I’ll never see your ass again
Wouldn't that be a shame
Cause look at all the shit we overcame
Made it through the flame and never got cremated
I made it to the fame and never got too jaded
All them other couples we fuck with, secretly hated
Flash forward it’s been years, we the only ones that made it
Shit, remember I was straying from home
And "Where I Wanna Be" was my favorite song
Sometimes I still be on my Donell Jones
But I just can’t leave you alone

[Chorus]
It's like she loves me
She loves me
And then she loves me not
She loves me not
Feel like she loves me
She loves me
And then she loves me not
She loves me not
Then she loves me not

She know me like a book, its too easy to read my ass
Unhappy stressed, yelling don’t mislead my ass
I mean I make it so easy to please my ass
The shoe was on the other foot and you would leave my ass
True that
My song all on the radio
Who Dat
Am I so far gone, used to see both sides like the Mohawk on
Now I know you wonder why this phone lock on
All this time that I’ve been with ya you ain't used to do that
I loved your ass way before I knew you could rap
The way you breaking my heart I should sue you for that
Call up my uncles and my cousins have them do you for that
We had a deal you ain't keeping up your end of the shit
In my mind I know she get the short end of the stick
Try to justify it thinking, man we finna be rich
Some bad bitch I barely know sending me flicks

[Chorus]
It's like she loves me
She loves me
And then she loves me not
She loves me not
Feel like she loves me
She loves me
And then she loves me not

This is Shaniya Davis, last seen wearing a blue sleep shirt and pink underwear. The search for the little girl is now entering its 11th hour in Fayetville, and there’s some disturbing new details

Hey, ah
I ain't ready yet
Yeah, I ain't ready yet
Yeah, hey
[Verse 1]
Gettin' higher than the soul of little Shaniya
And to the ones that killed her, hope you burn in fire
I’m burnin' tires on the strip, tryna get a grip
Liquor in the cupholder, tryna get a sip
6 shots of Hennessey, I’m still goin' strong
Please numb me from the bullshit that’s goin' on
That girl was 5 years old that they just murdered
And did some wicked shit to her that was unheard of
You fuckin' coward, ain’t gotta tell em’ go to Hell
'Cause that’s the shit that make them other niggas sick in jail
So you gon’ feel it
Travel the world reppin' this city, know I’m gon' kill it
But yet a nigga ain’t got a clue
How I’m gon' deal with all the bullshit
Niggas sendin' shots my way
You put a hit out on me, think that I’m gon' stop? No way
Gon' have to kill me, or witness a nigga livin' so filthy
Young, black, and wealthy, nigga for that I’m guilty
Still see all the fake shit, it’s funny somehow
Thought the money could erase it, no matter how
Much dough you got you gotta face it, and to my niggas gone
Hope you in a better place, if I make it I’ll holla…

[Chorus]

You’re no good, uh-uh, hey
Yeah, see world

No matter how I hate flashbacks and rewinds
Can’t escape the pain that be trapped in my mind
Nigga, see world
You’re no good
[Verse 2]
Uh, I got a chip on my shoulder the size of a Golden Nugget
The industry overlook me, for that I be holding grudges
Wouldn’t take a chance on me, suddenly it's, oh you love it
Let's get a Cole feature, that's gon' put you over budget, now
Picture being broke without no pot to piss in
And then suddenly your idols is your competition
Used to be like God to me, slowly losing my religion
As these notes from my composition turn to competitions, then
Put it out and hope the world sing
We sippin’ liquor for the pain that the world bring
We had dreams just to make it up the flag pole
Just to find out that our heroes were some assholes, y’all don't hear me
Maybe I had the world figured out wrong
When these niggas go from singing our songs and waiting on you
'Bout a year later the same ones be hatin’ on you
Every other record these rappers be faking on you
Dog, we sing your songs but we know that ain’t you
We know you gotta make the people pay you
'Cause either you play the game or watch the game play you
And be that broke muthafucker talkin' 'bout “I stayed true”

[Chorus]
Yeah, see world, huh-uh
You’re no good, uh-uh, hey
Yeah, see world
You’re no good, uh-uh
No matter how I hate flashbacks and rewinds
Can’t escape the pain that be trapped in my mind

Hey, farewell
All my niggas farewell
Fayettenam

[Verse 1]
Look, some niggas let their dirt out, some just keep it all in ‘em
So when a man dies all his secrets go with him
And fade, a part of history no longer known
Done did a lot of dirt I’ll bury with me when I’m gone
When my story’s told, how will they tell it?
Will they say I was a giver or remember I was selfish?
Will they say I was a sinner or pretend I was a saint?
Will I go down as a winner, what's the picture they gon' paint?
Wouldn’t say that I’m a quitter, that's one thing I know I ain't
Will they tarnish, will they taint? Glorify me, over-think?
Say they know me, say I’m great? Say I’m phoney, I was fake?
Say the things about me that they never told me to my face?
I was loved I was hated, just a nigga with a dream
I’m a liar, I was honest, I was all of these things
When I’m gone let em talk, they discussing who I am
When they bury me just know I wasn't nothing but a man
Wasn’t nothin’ but a man
[Chorus]
This for them niggas climbin’ heaven's stairwell
Yeah, hey farewell
Yeh, hey farewell
This for niggas climbin’ heaven's stairwell
I pray you farewell
I bid you farewell
Yeah, hey, farewell
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
If I should die Lord this here is my will
Reincarnate a nigga send me right back to the Ville
Let me relive my younger days just once again
Reenact my memories from every friend to every sin
Keeping demons buried in my closet
But yet I put in work like a deposit on my bank account
My eyes lit while I think about my childhood now I'm blanking out
Those were truly my best days
The only thing I had to stress was how the hell to get laid
Gradually turn into me stressin’ how the hell to get paid
Been making songs so long, now how the hell they get played
Ok, I’m blowing up quickly, I guess the flow is sickly
But yet I can’t forget my past and hope it won’t forget me
Got good grades but A's can’t stop strays so pray for me
Pour liquor for my niggas but hey, don’t wait for me
'Cause I’m trying to cheat death, she out to bury my ass
You know the cliche “life's a bitch” well I’m gon marry that ass
And sign a prenup, think back to when we tore the skating rink up
Rapping and we scrapping, we got older hit the teen club
Gave mean mugs to niggas but we winked to all the girls
Then we went back to the crib thinking we had saw the world
No sir, came a long way from having momma chauffer
It's hard to think these hoes at some point were so pure
But now we play the game, when it's over send me back
I swear I’m not gon change a thing
I swear I’m not gon change a thing
[Chorus]
This for niggas climbin’ heaven's stairwell
Yeah, hey farewell
Yeh, hey farewell
This for niggas climbin’ heaven's stairwell

Take off that Givenchy and let’s get raunchy
I'll have your face looking all Captain Crunch-y
The devil stay testing
'Cause when you chase the pussy, it’s a sin
But if it falls in your lap, it’s a blessin'
Soon as I got salad, I spent it all on dressing
French, to be exact, that Balmain was impressive
Hedi Slimane leathers...

[Interlude: CyHi the Prynce]
CyHi!
Yeah!
[Verse 3: CyHi the Prynce]
Boy, we lookin’ for trouble
Maybe if we wasn’t Black, then we wouldn’t have struggled
Player, all I got is trap niggas and crooks in my huddle
They cook and I smuggle, got 20 pounds of kush in the duffle
So I’m running through them circles, boy, I’m lookin like Knuckles
Look at my knuckles, got the hook in, ’cause niggas was looking
I’ve tooken some whoopings, so trust me, dog, I’m good for a scuffle
Don’t be mad I whooped your ass 'cause I’ve tooken a couple
Feds asking niggas questions, but I wouldn’t rebuttal
'Cause I’m Jake Gyllenhaal, I’m in the hood with the bubble
With a tall model broad like I took her from Russell
Didn’t play the cards I was dealt, I made the dealer re-shuffle
Huh, royal flush, so kiss my royal nuts
Ain’t nothing silver-spooned, I came from the soil, bruh
But now, I’m eatin’ off of Raffaello Gold
Exquisite ravioli with some happy yellow hoes
But don’t get it confused when I rap these mellow flows
'Cause all my Titos got bricks like the yellow road
[Interlude: Big Sean & Kanye West]
G.O.O.D.! I do it
Música bubble
Not looking for trouble
B-I-G, Sean Don, nigga
Looking for trouble, trouble, trouble
But you found it, motherfucker
Some shekels fe I shenks
Bitch! I'm in...
Just a burn up de lamb’s bread
[Verse 4: Big Sean]
... That no-smoke sec', rolling motherfucking ounces
Marijuana mountains, drinks you’re not pronouncing
Three chains on, I don’t need no bouncers
Nothing less than a G stashed in my trousers (Boy)
New double Ds smashed in her blouses
Fuck a hotel, my nigga we rent houses (Houses)
My nigga, we rent houses
So many wedding rings lost in them couches
I’m just a Westside lover
I leave females in my sheets and all my feelings in a rubber
This is showtime, showtime, boy, I hope you set the DVR
Stacking money face to face, this shit look like CPR
‘Ye invited me a seat to sit at the throne
So now I’m snappin’ like yo ass just finished the poem
Does he sound like 'Ye, Jay or Drizzy Drake? (Drizzy Drake)
Meanwhile I’m chillin’ with all these niggas, counting all this money you ain’t
Consider yourself lucky to see a legend before the prime
A killer before the crime, a B.I.G. before the dying
Greet me with a middle finger when you see me
It’s cool 'cause I can’t see yo ass from this side of the TV, motherfucker!
[Verse 5: J. Cole]
Hey, Cole World, make way for the chosen one
What you now hear is puttin’ fear in all the older ones
Downplayed me to downgrade me like they don’t notice him
Your shoes too big to fill? I can barely squeeze my toes in ‘em
Fucking hoes while teachin' niggas to hold your sons
This the rap Moses—scratch that, Mary and Joseph’s son
High as fuck with a cold flow and a loaded gun
Never say I’m better than Hov, but I’m the closest one
Heard you lookin’ for trouble, what, I’m 'sposed to run?
Your bitch invited me inside her, ain’t I 'sposed to come?
Got niggas that’ll blow your tee off, put a hole in one
Now you outside of Heaven’s gate, frontin’ like you know someone
Talking hard, but y’all still ain’t push me
They say you are what you eat, and I still ain’t pussy
Hmm, fuck it, everybody can get it
When you’re this hot, everybody’s a critic
But when you’re this high, everybody’s a midget
All this mean-mugging from niggas that mean nothing
Could it be my position is one that you dreamed of?
Went from quarter to broke to half-past-rich
With my badass bitch
And you don’t want no problems, on some math class shit
So check the young genius out
Fuck the world, bust a nut, and let my semen sprout
I thought that real shit is what you been fiending ’bout
What you been praying for? What you been screaming ’bout?
Ironic, you been sleeping on the one that you been dreaming 'bout37Embed​t h e . c l i m b . b a c k Lyrics[Intro]
Are you doin' this work to facilitate growth or to become famous?
Which is more important?
Getting or letting go?
You can do anything, anything you can do (You can do anything)
You can do anything, anything you can do (You can do anything)

[Chorus]
Everything come back around full circle
Why do lies sound pleasant, but the truth hurtful?
Everybody gotta cry once in a while
But how long will it take 'fore you smile?
This is that come-back-to-life shit
My niggas pick me up and we gon' light the city up as if the sun had the night shift
And paint the town red for my nigga found dead too soon (Bitch, I'm back out...)
[Verse 1]
Yeah
To the left of that decimal, I need seven figures to play the joint
Turn up your decibels, peep how I decimate a joint
Check out my projects like them workers that Section 8 appoints
And you'll see how I flipped like exclamation points
My niggas shoot first as if they never played the point, more two guards
Enough straps to fill four U-Hauls
More death than World War II caused
Around these parts we pour the brown just to drown these thoughts
Of black corpses in county morgues, Lord, those images hauntin'
I ain't been asleep yet, it's ten in the mornin'
I'm sendin' a warnin', a problem with me is like the BET Hip-Hop Awards
I'm startin' to see you niggas don't want it
I'm sick of this flauntin', from niggas I know for sure ain't got mo' dough than Cole
Trash rappers, ass backwards, tryna go toe-to-toe
We laugh at ya, staff strapped up on top the totem pole to blast at ya
Bassmasters, look how they tote a pole
Gotta know the ropes and the protocol
Or they gon' for sure blow your clothes half off like a promo code
Made a lil' tune called "Foldin Clothes," and a nigga still ain't known to fold under pressure
Well, you know what Cole do
Make a diamond, they just rhymin', me, I'm quotin' gold
One phone call get you canceled like a homophobe in this PC culture
Address me as the G.O.A.T. like they call Chief Keef Sosa
In my sectional like a fuckin' three-piece sofa
I'm known as the chosen one
Another dead body lay frozen, that's how it go sometimes
When niggas weighin' coke and not the pros and cons
Well, I ain't with that sleepin' underground like a gopher, so I go for mines
[Chorus]
Everything come back around full circle (Nigga, gotta go for mines)
Why do lies sound pleasant, but the truth hurtful? (Yeah)
Everybody gotta cry once in a while
But how long will it take 'fore you smile?
This is that come-back-to-life shit
My niggas pick me up and we gon' light the city up as if the sun had the night shift
And paint the town red for my nigga found dead too soon
Now I know why they call it blue moon (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
Survival at all costs, every day, niggas get logged off
Bodies get hauled off
Passin' a funeral procession while holdin' my breath in the car, I thought
At times, it be feelin' the devil be winnin' but do that mean God lost?
Just got off the phone with my nigga, he back in the kennel, my dog lost
I brought him 'round close to me before but he
Became addicted to clout and all the hoes we'd meet
I slowly peeped jealousy on his breath whenever he spoke to me
Like on the low, he feelin' that in my shoes is where he supposed to be
I tried to ignore the signs, but they're in the back of my mind
It felt like lettin' a nigga come sleep on your couch and he eatin' up all yo' groceries
My nigga repeated this quote to me, I felt its potency
Said, "Most of these niggas gon' hang themselves, just give 'em the rope and see"
Shit, I heeded that, and what got showed to me
Was screamin' that, some niggas, you gotta leave 'em back
Unfortunately we seen the trap
Niggas be on that demon clock resultantly
They fiend to clap as often as the Genius app misquotin' me, uh
Meanwhile, I see that yo' diamonds is glistenin'
I'm glad that you shinin', but need I remind you my niggas is dimin' and nickelin'?
Scrapin' up whatever coin they can find, the pettiest crime, they committin' it
Just to get by for a limited time, the steepest of mountains, they tryin' to climb
I'm here tryna find the derivative, you niggas don't feel me
You see the clout, you don't see the real me
If I was sick, you niggas wouldn't heal me
Therefore I'm healin' myself, gettin' in tune with my God
Slowly revealin' myself, buildin' my wealth
A nigga touch mine, I'ma kill 'em myself, trust me
[Chorus]
Everything come back around full circle
Why do lies sound pleasant, but the truth hurtful?
Everybody gotta cry once in a while
But how long will it take 'fore you smile?
This is that come-back-to-life shit
My niggas pick me up and we gon' light the city up as if the sun had the night shift
And paint the town red for my nigga found dead too soon
Now I know why they call it blue moon (Yeah)

[Outro]
Bitch, I'm back outside, nigga
I'm back outside
I'm back outside
I'm back outside
Everybody mentions suicide prevention
Man, they even made a hotline
To call up when there's tension, but I got a question
What about a fuckin' homicide?
Need a number for my niggas to call
Whenever there's a urge to get triggers involved
Need a number for my niggas to call
Whenever there's a urge to get triggers involved236Embed Lion King on Ice Lyrics[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Sip from the bottle for shit that we bottlin' in
Goin' live, but we not on the 'Gram
This the land of supply and demand
Where my young niggas choppin' up grams
And them choppers won't pry from they hands
Packin' lead like they got a exam
If it's beef, my niggas look just like homewreckers
They got they eye on your mans
I pray to God that it jam
Too many done died in these parts
So we gotta be smart if we tryna see August
Some niggas won't make it past summer regardless
I'm tryin' my hardest to stack my deposits
These niggas be lookin' at me like I got it
Deep down inside, though, I still feel as broke
As that nigga who just graduated from college
Scrapin' up change that got left in my pockets
I'm tryna make nickels turn into a dollar
Ridin' the train, way too shy to go holler
Just watched her get off at her stop, I'm a coward
Fuck it, though, you got a way bigger target
I'ma do it so big, they won't know what to call it
Sound like a whole Lambo' truck in my stomach
Bitch, I ain't hungry, this feeling is starving
Gotta move mama from out them apartments
Gotta put 'Ville on the map, we forgotten
Gotta hit hoes you hang up in your locker
Gotta get rich, 'cause my granny picked cotton
Gotta make hits, 'cause if not, then I'm floppin'
Gotta stay me in the process
Niggas dissed me, it was nonsense
I sat 'em down like his father
My nigga asked, "Why you bother?
We should've caught him and mobbed him"
I said, "We gotta move smarter"
Don't wan' be the reason for one more sad song
I tried to warn niggas they wouldn't last long
I hope that you see how they came and they went
They shots never hit, but they made they attempts
May have a good year like that name on the blimp
But you know what it takes to be poppin' this long?
Dedication on another level niggas never seen in they life
Celebratin' all your first downs like they touchdowns bring a price
Young Simba had the bustdown, yeah, the Lion King on ice
Niggas wanted me to look the part, had to stop takin' advice
Put the jewelry to the side, had to find me, had to find God
Half the time, we be pacifyin', what they expect from us?
But that's treacherous, that shows less of us
I need y'all to see every part of me
Every scar and every artery
Every story that I can recall, then I can fall
[Chorus]
I got blood on my hands, I ain't gon' lie
I got mud on my shoes, I ain't gon' lie
I got real, real big plans, I ain't gon' lie
Got a whole lot to prove, I ain't gon' lie
I got blood on my hands, I ain't gon' lie
I got mud on my shoes, I ain't gon' lie
I got real, real big plans, I ain't gon' lie
Got a whole lot to prove, I ain't gon' lie (Uh)

[Verse 2]
Lately, I reflect on the times a nigga was low
I got it up off the floor, I'm stronger than ever before
I'm stronger than ever before just like I planned to be
They wanna see me fold, it ain't no thang to me
Thoughts when I was broke, if only I could be
Pockets holdin' hope, it ain't no thang to me
At night, I hit my knees, I prayed for better days
Then found a better me, I got my head on straight

[Outro]
Up, up, and away, just ridin' my wave, I ain't never gon' say nothin'
Nigga throw a shot my way, I just jot down names, ain't never gon' say nothin'
Know you be stressin', hate only block your blessin', I'm never gon' say nothin'
Quit all that flexin', niggas live check to check, I'm never gon' say nothin'

Cole World, Killa Cam', niggas is fuckin' finished (Yeah)

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
This shit too easy for me now
Nigga, Cole been goin' plat' since back when CDs was around
What you sold, I tripled that, I can't believe these fuckin' clowns
Look how everybody clappin' when your thirty-song album do a measly hundred thou'
If I'm bettin' on myself, then I completely double down
If you hated on a nigga, please don't greet me with a pound
I be stayin' out the way, but if the beef do come around
Could put a M right on your head, you Luigi brother now
Trace my steps all in this game, you could see we cover ground
Back and forth from NC to New York when Jeezy had the crown
Vivid memories, niggas start to squeeze, we duckin' down
So many shells left on the ground, it make the Easter Bunny proud
I get up, dust my clothes off, sleep is the cousin of death
No plans to doze off, the streets, it don't come with a ref'
I never sold soft, just creeped where the hustlers crept
And got they O's off, you reach, niggas uppin' like Steph
To blow your nose off, gesundheit, and then resume flight
As if it never happened, shit we witnessed full of so much sickness
Angels sheddin' tears in Heaven, word to Eric Clapton
Off this clever rappin', bitch, my pockets gon' forever fatten
[Interlude: J. Cole & Cam'ron]
They gon' forever fatten
See, we tried to tell niggas
They act like they don't even fuckin' speak English

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Bitch, my pen to the paper's lethal
I'm sendin' 'em straight to meet the
The nigga that made them, peep the reaper
Creepin' on ya, the scent of failure reekin' on ya
Check your genitalia, pussy-niggas bleedin' on yourself
Fuckin' with Cole is bold, but it's impedin' on your health
All yo' niggas eatin' off your wealth
All my niggas feedin' all they selves, and it feels swell
Krispy Kreme dreams, sometime my dawgs wanna kill 12 (Uh)
'Cause they steady harassin'
We seen dilemmas like Nelly and Kelly that end in the deadliest fashion
My young niggas nutty, they blastin'
Bullets be hummin' like Cudi but one of yo' hoodies Spaghetti-O splashin'
All over the driveway, y'all talkin' all sideways
Shots poppin' off, y'all laid down
Cops chalkin' off y'all legs now
(Shit) God watchin', "Hey, Yahweh"
My niggas looked up to the sky like we sendin' 'em y'all way (Y'all way)
We sendin' 'em y'all way (Y'all way)

Plottin' my escape, this game rot a nigga's faith
Got a couple M's hidin' in the safe
Imagination turned a Honda into Wraith
I was doin' eighty on the interstate
Tryna make it back before my class started
Country nigga never seen a passport
'Til I popped off and got a bag for it
Now I'm at the Garden sittin' half court
Watchin' Jr. catch it off the backboard
'Ville nigga never seen nothing
'Cept a fucking triple beam jumping
Good dope leave a fiend krumping
Made it out, it gotta mean something

Either you gon' hustle or that nigga Uncle Sam got yo' ass re-enlisting
2-6, murder scene pumping
Better leave it tucked if you ain't dumping
Pow, pow, nigga, he slumping
Twelve comin', we ain't seen nothing
Time change, niggas ain't rumbling no more
Nah, what for? Hungry for more
If you solo these vocals, listen close and you can hear grumbling
Multi' and I'm still munching
Big bag, never fear fumbling
Want smoke? Nigga don't choke
I'm a whole fuckin' nicotine company
Dreamville the Army, not a Navy
How could you ever try to play me?
Kill 'em on a song, walk up out the booth, do the Westbrook rock-a-baby
I never fall out with the bro
Hate when your family turn into foe
We had a penthouse on the road
Interior decorated with the hoes
Just like a multiple-choice getting chose
My niggas like "Eenie, meenie, miney, moe"
Scoop up a dime-piece like we homeless
Then we gon' send 'em back pigeon-toed
Out of the concrete was a rose and winters was cold
Had to go over and stand by the stove
We from the Southeast, niggas know
This where the opps creep real slow
Won't vote but they mob deep with the poles
I punch the time sheet, not no more
And now my assigned seat is the throne

Plottin' my escape, this game rot a nigga's faith

Spiralin' up, just like a rich nigga staircase (Spiral up)
No fly zone, please stay the fuck out my airspace (Out my face)
Niggas say things behind backs that they wouldn't dare say (Dare say)
Know it's on sight when I see you, I'm workin' at Squarespace
Yeah, top of the mornin', I know that you thought I was dormant
Woke up early from shots that were swarmin'
A block full of opps, now the cops in an orbit
Guess somebody got popped, now thеy knockin' on doors
Tryna find an informant but I ain't see Nathan
I'm mindin' my business as God is my witness
No weapon gon' prospеr that’s formin' against me
Nigga, I'm starvin', immensely
Know when I'm done with these songs, you gon' miss me
Ja Morant, I'm on my Grizzly
You niggas just cubs but no, not the ones in the big leagues
After The Fall Off, I promise I'm comin' to sellin' out Wrigley's
Nigga, I'm just a product of poverty, full of narcotics to profit off quickly
My family tree got a history of users that struggle with demons
Not really the hustler instincts
Therefore, often, my pockets was empty
So while some of my partners was servin' up rocks on the corners, the project assemblies
Me, I was startin' to envy, wanna be on the top where it's plenty
Wanna be in the spot like where every bitch want me like Rihanna droppin' new Fenty
What I see in the sky, the 'Ville is the ceilin', can't reach up too high, evidently
Nah, shit, I can't reach up too high, evidently
Never seen no one drivin' a Bentley
I can't be out here moppin' up Wendy's
[Chorus: Morray, J. Cole, Morray & J. Cole]
My life is all I have
My rhymes, my pen, my pad
And I done made it out the struggle, don't judge me

'Cause where I come from (Come from), so often (So often)
People you grow up with layin' in a coffin
But I done made it through the pain and strife
It's my time now, my world, my life, my life

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
Say what? The stuff that I've seen got me traumatized
I let the K go when Johnny died
Swangin' that muhfucka' side to side
We don't participate, ain't with that squashin' shit, all we believe in is homicide
I got a good heart, so I send teddy bears every time we make they mommas cry
I pray that my past ain't ahead of me (21)
When I'm in love, I love heavily (On God)
If you betray me, you dead to me (21)
I disrespect you respectfully (Straight up)
I got some partners who left this Earth
Maybe the pain made a better me (On God)
Just know that they secrets is kept with me (On God)
I feel like the streets is in debt with me (Straight up)
I gave my heart away to all the dawg hoes 'cause that's who accepted me (21)
I blame my pops for that shit 'cause if he didn't fail, he could've corrected me (21)
Give all the props to my momma 'cause no matter what, she always protected me (On God)
I promise you, it ain't no checkin' me (On God)
Jump in the water, get wet with me (Straight up, 21, 21)
You want my money or wanna have sex with me?
Can't let the opps or the law get the best of me
I get to answerin', you get to testin' me
I see chicken, you niggas is breast to me
Planted a seed but it ain't a sesame
Can't let you niggas or bitches grow next to me

Uh, applying pressure
Started my grind where crime festers
And nines showing like they in they second trimesters (Pregnant)
That’s why when niggas throw a shot or two online, I pay no mind to their benign gesturеs (Mm)
Nigga, please, I got my mind on much bigger things, to say thе least
My latest speeches sound like they was released by David East (What up, East?)
Verses hit hard, never pitched hard or played the streets
These niggas' whips hard, behind closed doors, can't pay the lease (Uh)
Ain't nothin' wrong with livin' check to check 'cause most have to (I understand that)
Instead of cappin', why don’t you talk about being a broke rapper? (I don’t understand that)
That's a perspective I respect because it’s real
What it's like to be nice as fuck but got to stress to pay the bills
That was me in '08, seein' no cake
Not even on dates I celebrated my birth
Just did the mental math and calculated my worth
Shit crazy, didn’t know I got more M's than a real Slim Shady video (I'm the real Shady)
Big Boss, less Rick Ross, more like a wavy Hideo
Kojima, they tote steamers around the way we tippy-toe
'Round crack vials and cold-blooded killers, no reptiles
Just projectiles from niggas salty, you rockin' the fresher textiles
I seen best pals grow up and switch (I hate to see it)
Sometimes over a couple dollars, more often over a bitch (Ah, I hate to see it)
I can cap and say that I never scratched my jealousy's itch
But thank God I conquered that 'cause if not I'd never be rich
Envy keep your pockets empty, so just focus on you
If you broke and clownin' a millionaire, the joke is on you
Money ain't everything, I never say that (Never)
But niggas throw stones knowin' they sell they soul to get wherever they at (Come on, man)
Just know these verses is some shit they gon' forever playback, nigga (Come on, nigga)
[Outro]
Hell yeah (Ooh)
Fuck, you know what it is, nigga
Don't even dare
Niggas try to act like they don't—, bitch
That's why I gotta flex sometimes
'Cause niggas just try to act like you just not that motherfuckin' nigga, like
Like you just really don't do it how you do it
Like niggas will really try to act like you don't do what you do
Nigga look you dead in your face
And really act like you don't do it to the level that you do it
That's why sometimes you gotta come through and just do it at the level that you do it in front of every nigga face
So they know the difference between you, the real niggas, and the mothafuckin' fraudulent niggas, man
Don't never get it fucked up
If a nigga can't do it like you do it sometimes you gotta do it in front of his fuckin' face so he'll know forever
"Damn, that nigga did it how I always wanted to do it and I'll never be able to do it like that"
Bitch, it's a difference (Ah)
(These are the same ones telling our people what we are and we aren't because we're just not working hard enough
And that mentality is what we're up against today
But this is good to know because this time, when we march on the Capitol
You can go ahead and let 'em know long before we get there, we're coming to get that check)102Embed ​​p u n c h i n ’ . t h e . c l o c k Lyrics[Intro: J. Cole & Damian Lillard]

Back on top, punchin' the clock, clutchin' sanity

Paid off collections from recollections of calamity (Oh shit, look, that nigga gonna shoot)
The shit pop off, I learned to duck under the canopy (Oh shit, run, nigga, run)
'Til it cool off, they murked a nigga right in front of me
Told him to come off his chain for tryna floss
Died over a cross just like the start of Christianity
When I was a boy, the teacher often reprimanded me (Jermaine)
Thought it was toys, it was a Glock this nigga handed me
I busted the trees, was barely strong enough to squeeze
Bullets traveled through leaves, it probably killed somebody randomly
Ran in the crib and played it off amongst the family
Nightmare scenes, the police finally apprehended me
Woke up screamin', seen a demon had his hand on me
Still sport the scar on my arm from where he branded me
Like a Que Dog, my niggas burnin' with the mute off
Loud pack smoke through the cracks, I catch a contact
Triggerin' a paranoid mindset, now I'm back
Teeterin' between enlightened and insanity
Now that I'm rich, I feel nobody understandin' me
All I can do is cut the mic on, holler at you
Can't let the fame scare me off from speaking candidly
All them niggas is so Kane, they started singin' like Danity
Now I'm left here, paid like I planned to be, damn
[Outro: Damian Lillard]
A lot of times, those situations are, um, are handled way before the time comes
In the summer, I think when you truly prepare yourself, and
With training and conditioning, and things like that
When you cheat yourself, you fail in those moments
You know, you crash, and when you really put the time in and
Whether people see it, or whether people know it or not
You know, it always come to light83Embed 1 0 0 . m i l ’ Lyrics[Pre-Chorus]

Never peddled rock, never said a lot, only what need to be said
Got a little guap, when you get a lot, won't no bitch leave you on read
Don't push me, nigga, my feet on thе ledge
This game is likе follow the leader, if you looking closely enough, then you'll see that I led
The moves that I made, the people I fed, the evil I ducked
They minds is too feeble, they lean on they crutch
I'm bleeding from fighting my demons head up
When I get defeated, believe I get up
I come from a city most niggas ain't heard of until they popped in my first CD, now look
I'm on that Mount Rushmore, you niggas can't front no more, bitch, I'ma reign until FEMA show up
When shots got to ringing, like freedom, I ducked
E&J fell out my cup
Them bullets fly by, that shit sober you up
I'm proud of my niggas, they never switched up
Don't care if it's Michael B. Jordan that's calling my woman to fuck, she ain't gon' never pick up
Sadly, I can't say the same for you niggas
A couple of dollars be changing you niggas
I pray for you niggas, but

Terrified, paranoid, I'll put you over everything to fill the void
And when you're gone, will I have anything or will I be destroyed? Yеah

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Bright lights pass me in the city, it’s emеrgency
I'm thankful 'cause I made it past my thirties, no one murdered me
Still remember vividly the nigga that pulled a gun on me
I'm petrified, but moving like I got no sense of urgency
Pride make a nigga act way harder than he really be
Pride hide the shame when city cut off all utilities
Pride hide the pain of growing up inhaling poverty
Pride make a nigga feel a way that you unfollowed me
Make a nigga flash a thousand like he hit the lottery
Make a baby mama make shit harder than it gotta be
Make you have to take the bitch to court to see your prodigy
Make you have to use your last resort and pull a robbery
Pride be the reason for the family dichotomy
Got uncles and some aunties that's too proud to give apologies
Slowly realizing what the root of all my problems be
It got me feeling different when somebody say they proud of me

Too much money to count, what’s the amount?
Check never bounce
I gotta pay a nigga to add it up
Then pay somebody to make sure whatever amount he say he can back it up
Got racks on racks, I'm rackin’ up, stackin' up
You're reachin', I’m actin' up

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Break it down, weigh it up, now bag it up
Making five a month, that's regular
Nigga playing with us, that's a negative
Go back to start, that's never
I'm a boss, my closet leather
Ain't no off-days on my schedule
Long as I live, we live forever
Told my twin this shit get better
These niggas done slipped, let me ahead 'em
Got my feet up, I paid silly bands to have sex on the jet
I don't need 'em, that shit in the past, I'm feelin' like what's next
Got my speed up, foot all on the gas, this not a C8 'Vette
I can beat 'em, I believe in me, just tell me what's the bet
All my pride gone, had to lose it all then I got rich
I own five homes, glad some of this shit starting to make sense
I'm staying hella focused and I can't forget the bigger picture
I can't even hold you, I didn't have shit, I won't forget it
Will I be destroyed?
Come to me with everything, it's starting to get annoying
I'm addicted to promethazine, it's crazy, yeah, I know it
All this money coming in, it drive me crazy not to show it
I'll be crazy if I blow it

Soldier's song, marching on, on
Hoping to see home
If I die before I
See your smile just one more time

[Verse: J. Cole]
Sometimes I question whether this shit matters
Puttin' substance into something in a world so used to instant gratification
I found this instrumental on my phone while on vacation
Ib sent it a year ago or so
I probably heard it before, but slept on it, you know?
Shit don't always connect as soon as you press play
At times you gotta step away, do some livin'
Let time provide a new prescription, givin' truer vision
I dibble-dabble in a few religions
My homie constantly telling me 'bout Quran, puttin' me on
I read a few pages and recognize the wisdom in it
But I ain't got the discipline for stickin' with it
Now I'm on the way to London, got a show for seven digits
I'm wonderin' just when did I become my biggest critic?
I wanna be my biggest fan, like how I was when didn't nobody know my jams
Today my son said, "Dad, let go my hand"
Reminded me one day he's gonna be his own man
And my job is to make sure he's equipped
I gotta make sure he not no bitch 'cause niggas bound to try him
If I said I was the toughest growin' up, I would be lyin'
I had a fear of gettin' punched while everybody eyein'
Add to that a constant fear of dyin'
By gunshot wound, the other violent type of endings
I kept a tough demeanor on the surface but was mostly just pretendin'
Luckily my bluff was workin' way more often than not
But sometimes a nigga pulled my card, tryna expose me for a fraud
And with my reputation at stake
I was scufflin' just to save face
Couple wins, couple losses, some broken up too quick to call it
My last scrap was with Puff Daddy, who would've thought it?
I bought that nigga album in seventh grade and played it so much
You would've thought my favorite rapper was Puff
Back then I ain't know shit, now I know too much
Ignorance is bliss and innocence is just ignorance before it's introduced to currency and clips
Or bad licks that have a nigga servin' three to six, shit

Time will right the wrongs

How can we grow any closer?
How can we grow any closer?
How can we grow any closer?

Something inside of me's tryna crawl up to the surface
Something is suddenly smothering, stopping me
Stubbornly getting its way (Way), way (Way)
Drowning out the wave (Drowning out)

It's like you never lived for me, yeah
Mama said you was a good thing, uh
Good, good, good, yeah

We came a long way, man, we done came a long way
And we sittin' on top of this shit
This shit can go one of two ways
This shit can go up, it can go down
Either way, nigga, I'm prepared
Feel me? Yeah
[Verse]
I be comin' in peace, but fuck me
Best beware of the others
This shit deep, undercovers creep
This Southern heat make unbearable summers
Just last week, seen yo' mama weep
Crying 'cause she don't wan' bury your brother
The blood lеaks while the EMTs
Gotta carry her baby likе surrogate mothers
Woah, thank God we survived around where the terrorists hovered
Though traumatized, wouldn't trade it for nothin'
Through hard times, it was there I discovered
A hustle and makin' the best out the struggle
I kept grindin' 'til this day, up a level
Respect mine, gotta stay out of trouble
'Cause TEC-9s like to air out rebuttals
Cole World, niggas knowin' what it is
Just in case they don't, I show 'em what it is
This summer, I do real numbers
Couldn't dare touch it if they sold a double disc
Block hot, niggas burnin' up the street
Shots poppin' and we heard it up the street
It's a war, niggas runnin' up the score
Jesus said that you should turn the other cheek
Was his niggas gettin' murdered every week?
Dead bodies, smell the odor in the street
My homie' homie got out on parole
He sold more Coca-Cola than the soda industry
Summertime bring the coldest winter breeze
Hella blues like the Rollin' 60s
Christ went to Heaven age thirty-three
And so did Pimp C and so did Nipsey
[Outro]
I told you, I told you
This shit can go up, it can go down, I don't give a fuck
Nigga, I done seen the highest heights
I done seen it twice
And I've seen the lowest of the lows
And still I rose
Now I'm at your neck, nigga, yeah240Embed ​t h e . c l i m b . b a c k Lyrics[Intro]

Which is more important?
Getting or letting go?
You can do anything, anything you can do (You can do anything)
You can do anything, anything you can do (You can do anything)

Everything come back around full circle
Why do lies sound pleasant, but the truth hurtful?
Everybody gotta cry once in a while
But how long will it take 'fore you smile?
This is that come-back-to-life shit
My niggas pick me up and we gon' light the city up as if the sun had the night shift
And paint the town red for my nigga found dead too soon (Bitch, I'm back out...)
[Verse 1]
Yeah
To the left of that decimal, I need seven figures to play the joint
Turn up your decibels, peep how I decimate a joint
Check out my projects like them workers that Section 8 appoints
And you'll see how I flipped like exclamation points
My niggas shoot first as if they never played the point, more two guards
Enough straps to fill four U-Hauls
More death than World War II caused
Around these parts we pour the brown just to drown these thoughts
Of black corpses in county morgues, Lord, those images hauntin'
I ain't been asleep yet, it's ten in the mornin'
I'm sendin' a warnin', a problem with me is like the BET Hip-Hop Awards
I'm startin' to see you niggas don't want it
I'm sick of this flauntin', from niggas I know for sure ain't got mo' dough than Cole
Trash rappers, ass backwards, tryna go toe-to-toe
We laugh at ya, staff strapped up on top the totem pole to blast at ya
Bassmasters, look how they tote a pole
Gotta know the ropes and the protocol
Or they gon' for sure blow your clothes half off like a promo code
Made a lil' tune called "Foldin Clothes," and a nigga still ain't known to fold under pressure
Well, you know what Cole do
Make a diamond, they just rhymin', me, I'm quotin' gold
One phone call get you canceled like a homophobe in this PC culture
Address me as the G.O.A.T. like they call Chief Keef Sosa
In my sectional like a fuckin' three-piece sofa
I'm known as the chosen one
Another dead body lay frozen, that's how it go sometimes
When niggas weighin' coke and not the pros and cons
Well, I ain't with that sleepin' underground like a gopher, so I go for mines
[Chorus]
Everything come back around full circle (Nigga, gotta go for mines)
Why do lies sound pleasant, but the truth hurtful? (Yeah)
Everybody gotta cry once in a while
But how long will it take 'fore you smile?
This is that come-back-to-life shit
My niggas pick me up and we gon' light the city up as if the sun had the night shift
And paint the town red for my nigga found dead too soon
Now I know why they call it blue moon (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
Survival at all costs, every day, niggas get logged off
Bodies get hauled off
Passin' a funeral procession while holdin' my breath in the car, I thought
At times, it be feelin' the devil be winnin' but do that mean God lost?
Just got off the phone with my nigga, he back in the kennel, my dog lost
I brought him 'round close to me before but he
Became addicted to clout and all the hoes we'd meet
I slowly peeped jealousy on his breath whenever he spoke to me
Like on the low, he feelin' that in my shoes is where he supposed to be
I tried to ignore the signs, but they're in the back of my mind
It felt like lettin' a nigga come sleep on your couch and he eatin' up all yo' groceries
My nigga repeated this quote to me, I felt its potency
Said, "Most of these niggas gon' hang themselves, just give 'em the rope and see"
Shit, I heeded that, and what got showed to me
Was screamin' that, some niggas, you gotta leave 'em back
Unfortunately we seen the trap
Niggas be on that demon clock resultantly
They fiend to clap as often as the Genius app misquotin' me, uh
Meanwhile, I see that yo' diamonds is glistenin'
I'm glad that you shinin', but need I remind you my niggas is dimin' and nickelin'?
Scrapin' up whatever coin they can find, the pettiest crime, they committin' it
Just to get by for a limited time, the steepest of mountains, they tryin' to climb
I'm here tryna find the derivative, you niggas don't feel me
You see the clout, you don't see the real me
If I was sick, you niggas wouldn't heal me
Therefore I'm healin' myself, gettin' in tune with my God
Slowly revealin' myself, buildin' my wealth
A nigga touch mine, I'ma kill 'em myself, trust me

Everything come back around full circle
Why do lies sound pleasant, but the truth hurtful?
Everybody gotta cry once in a while
But how long will it take 'fore you smile?

And paint the town red for my nigga found dead too soon

To call up when there's tension, but I got a question
What about a fuckin' homicide?

Gotta be patient and trust in God, He the coach
Temptations are taking a shortcut, but I don't
'Cause I ain't tryna be a almost, when I get it, I'ma float
Gone are the days we was close
Now when I see you, I look at you just like a ghost
A shell of your former self, so caught up with that dope
Two niggas singin' two diffеrent notes and you know I gotta coast
Nothin' but a dollar and some hopе
Up in NY, but damn, what hurts me the most
You was a good nigga, we knew each other's folks
Now you gotta ride around with the toast and you keep that shit close
'Cause niggas plottin' on you since you chose
To roll around with the candy paint on spokes
You know 'Ville niggas don't like it when you boast
You know twelve be takin' notes and they watchin' you close
But maybe you don't see 'em 'cause the smoke
Cloudin' your vision from every cigar that you toke
Plus the lean you sippin' which started as a joke
Got you now fiendin' for your next dose, meanwhile I'm so close
Don't even give a fuck that I'm broke
'Cause in my mind I'm rich with shit I done wrote
Therefore I'm convinced that this is supposed to happen
And in time I'ma blow, they gon' label me the GOAT
How long has it been since we spoke?
Last night I jumped up from my sleep, I was soaked
Call it a nightmare, the scene that awoke me
Involved you and niggas I ain't know, they was creepin' up close
I saw the heat tucked in they coats
You didn't notice 'cause you was busy countin' dough
I tried to yell, but nothin' came out of my throat
Niggas cocked back the hammers and you froze, in your eyes I saw hope
Hope of a better way to cope with the pain
And the scars, than the lean and the coke
And I swear in that moment I wish we were still close
Maybe I could've saved you, but no, trigger squeeze, gun smoke
I opened up my eyes with a jolt
Heart pumpin' like Usain Bolt
Reached for my phone, missed calls and a text message note
From my mama sayin' you just got smoked, damn, this life is no joke

Yeah
You ever prayed for something your whole life?
I mean, all you dreamed about was this one thing
I mean, you know it’s coming
You have faith and all that
But sometimes
Sometimes you second guess yourself
That’s human nature I suppose, second guessing
When life seems to take you through more downs than ups
Seems like it gives you more losses than wins
But do you stand tall and be bold
Or do you fold?
Do you believe?
See, me, I came a long way
Way too far for me to stop now
Not that I would stop anyways, but
I’m so close, I can feel it
Can you feel it?

Nothing else can do the trick like hard liquor to the brain
Fall victim to the game, all this money we spent
In my mind, tryna figure where this 20 G's went
Maybe I should slow it down, maybe take the pace slow
Second thought, I think I need to speed it up and make mo'
Time to build, Lego, in the Ville, laid low
Counting days, still waiting on that shit I prayed for
Am I ungrateful? Want it all so quick
Feel a vibrate, hold up, I got a call, old bitch
How she get my new shit? Swear the city too small
Type of chick won't take her shirt off 'cause her titties too small
I could give a damn, girl, lift up that pretty blue bra
Now I'm in the deep, seeing just how pretty you are
And that kitty go hard
Lord, I'm up in that
Got the type of kitty cat that make a nigga double back
Type of shit that make a nigga wanna fall in love with that

If I die 'fore I wake, hope my songs live on
Will they miss me when I'm gone and if so, for how long?
So much shit is on my brain, try hard to maintain
Sit and analyze my thoughts, at times I wonder if I'm sane
Man, it's hard to trust friends when the paranoia blends
With the marijuana, wonder will this high ever end?
Swear I'll never smoke again, y'all niggas blow the weed
Let me take another shot, man, this liquor's all I need
Just to put me in the zone, so far away from home
Nobody truly know me, got me feelin' so alone
They wonder what's on my mind, what's lingerin' in my dome

Hope them niggas ain't got no problems with me
My momma told me to speak like you got a college degree
You see, I can, but I won’t 'cause I’m saying what I want
Plus this slang that I speak don't change that I'm deep

As we headed to the crib, yes, I let her give me head
So she won't 'member where I live, my game is tight
Baby, no need to bring pajamas, you ain't stayin' the night
No disrespect, I just say it polite
I drop her off before I sleep, I be praying for life
Like Hov said it, can I live?
Ayy, dear Lord, can I live?
Hey, now am I living to get paid, just slaves for a wage, are we?
I can't do no 9-to-5, told my momma sorry
I can't do no suit and tie, no I want the glory
If you knew me, know my life is like a movie starring me
Pardon me, if it seems that I'm following my dreams
I ain't reading off the script that they picked for me
I ain't pissed, nah, couldn’t give a shit hardly
I'll be shitting on them niggas that was shitting on me
Will I live or will I die before they get to know me?
If I go, I know the ones that’s pouring liquor for me
And I know them fake niggas really hating on me
Knew that I was 'bout to blow, so they was waiting on me
[Bridge]
But oh no, Lord
You see, I'm smarter than they know
So hold on, Lord, 'cause I ain't quite ready to go
Can I live?
Somebody told me that it's only one shot
So I'll be goddamned if I'm ever gonna stop
Promise to my momma I'ma make it to the top
So I'ma keep climbing 'til my heartbeat drop

[Verse 2]
Like the phone when she heard the news
Her sister on the other line talking to her shoes
The only son, what a thing to lose
More blacks singing more blues
More niggas pouring more brews
Poor dude, he was young like 21, straight up out that city that I'm from
A real smart nigga, but his niggas, they was dumb
He ain't even get a chance to run
Before it landed in his lung
God, breathe nigga
His partner screaming “Don’t you fucking leave, nigga!”
Took off his shirt, tryna stop the bleeding nigga, “Don’t you go!”
But his life fading slow
Did I tell my mom I love her, do she know?
Did I tell my baby sorry from before?
Won't get to see my son grow
Lord, I ain't ready to go
Can I live? Can I live? Dear Lord, Can I live?
Can I live?27Embed Grown Simba Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, uh

[Verse 1]
Now, I was dreaming 'bout a deal at the age of thirteen
I was fiending for the mills, I ain't talking Burger King
Some of my niggas in the 'Ville, all they did was serve fiends
Fuck scales, I had skills, all day rehearsing
Them pretty boys had them gals, spent they time flirting
All they wanted was some waves like they fucking surfing
Hold up, now, don’t get it twisted, I ain't hating, do your thing
I was like a young Simba; couldn’t wait to be the king
Now, a nigga is the prince
Hopped over the fence where the grass way greener
Look at shawty ass, way meaner
Something like Serena mixed with Trina—have you seen her?
She fine enough to be Ms. Howard, word to Adina
My money like a senior, watch it graduate
Now, it's time to eat, I’m letting all my niggas grab a plate
Gravitate to real shit, stay away from phonies
These niggas heard about me, now they acting like they know me
[Chorus]
Keep on saying, “Where you going, nigga?”
Shit, it ain't no telling, huh, yeah
“Ayy, where you going, nigga?”
Hey, it ain't no telling, yeah
They keep on saying “Where you going, nigga?” Going, nigga
Ayy, it ain't no telling (Yeah)
Can’t tell you where I’m going, just know I won't stop
Goodbye to the bottom, hello to the top, ugh

[Verse 2]
Pardon the interruption, a proper introduction is necessary
When your shit is legendary, man
Greedy niggas wouldn’t let me in the cafeteria'n
'Cause they ain't believe, suddenly they Presbyterian
The hoes is librarians; they looking me up
She got to Jones like Marion, she licking me up
Then we cut, look how she say my name
I got her moaning, "J. Cole", they used to say "Jermaine"
I never change, I'm like a corpse in a coffin; six feet, shit's deep
I was low, just a dollar and some hope fixed me
'Cause I was broke, plus the weed that I would smoke would make it worser
Lord, please let my problems disappear like Ron Mercer
I’m a star; Converses
Conversing with them girls with them curves like cursive
They open like curtains
'Cause my shit is unheard of like curses on the radio
Same bitches used to play me though
[Chorus]
Now, they yelling, “Where you going, nigga?”
Shit, it ain't no telling, huh, yeah
“Ay, where you going, nigga?”
Shit, it ain't no telling, yeah
They keep on saying “Where you going, nigga?” Going, nigga
It ain't no telling, yeah
I can’t tell you where I’m going, just know I won't stop
Goodbye to the bottom (Yeah), hello to the top, yeah

[Verse 3]
I left the city for a minute, but it's still on my back
Told my niggas "Ay, I'm finna put the Ville on the map
I'll be back, and I'm coming with a deal and a plaque."
'Cause I'm ill, bitch, they couldn’t make a pill for the rap
Pouring liquor for my niggas that was killed, send 'em back
Came home, shit is real, niggas still in the trap
Hold up, now, don’t get it twisted, if you slang, do your thing
Me, I'm like a young Simba; I can't wait to be the king
Witness the dream
Straight out that Carolina water, I was brought up
In the city where the skinny niggas tryna be the ballers
Ain't no fathers, but the skinny niggas tryna hit they daughters
Sneaking in her crib, but her momma never caught us
What they taught us?
Man, them bad bitches only want the ballers, the starters
We hooping, now the hoes wanna guard us
Ugh, okay, so play D—know what I mean?
And I, I, I'll put you on the team
Man, this life is but a dream, and I need a fast car
Bad broads, fast forward; passport, I'm a fucking rap star
[Outro]
“Ayy, where you going, nigga?”
Shit, it ain't no telling, yeah
They say this life is but a dream, well, I need a fast car
Bad broads, fast forward; passport, I'm a fucking rap star
“Ayy, where you going, nigga?"
Yeah, it ain't no telling27Embed Just to Get By Lyrics[Intro]
"That was the warm up, that was the warm up, baby
Aight, Elite, for real, one take, dawg, and I'm up outta here
One, yup, yeah."

[Verse]
Lord, please forgive me for my sinning
I ain’t saying that I’m finished, but I’m praying in advance
Cause the way her eyes glance like they playing in my pants
Yeah, ball game
I swear the hoes wasn’t in my plans when a nigga took the chance and came to the big city
My beat machine the only fucking thing I had with me
Like Bobby had Whitney, we was cooking up crack
But them fifteen credits had a nigga off track
Picture that, best rapper since Lil Wayne in classes
The best bachelor since Bruce Wayne with his bachelor’s
But mastered this rap shit
You hear the words coming from my lips bastards
I never crack, I got that Chapstick
I practiced till that shit made perfect and served it to the people on a silver platter
Now where’s the ladder?
Cause either you gonna whine or you climb; I chose the latter
Know you haters is pissed, hold your bladder though
‘Fore you get tossed like a forward lateral
We never tattle, let God handle that
Or let the mob handle that
No Soprano, half black, half white; I’m a piano
I’m an animal, my video on Discovery Channel
I’m a beast when my shit hits the streets, these niggas cease to exist
Like a beach in a tsunami,  you'll find me in the ‘Ville
In the state of NC
Bitch, if I ain’t back home, I’m up in NYC
‘Bout that money prob-ly like a fucking robbery
But I ain’t jacking
I’m chasing dreams sort of like jeans, boy, I ain’t slacking
I’m chasing dreams sort of like jeans, boy, I ain’t slacking
Hey, take a hard look at my drive nigga, no hacking on my shit
I’m straight smacking niggas, straight tagging niggas
Yo, I freestyle and fuck you niggas, ya’ll be wilding and I’m out6Embed Lights Please Lyrics[Verse 1]
Yeah, I had this little bad thing, somethin' like them tens
She gave a nigga mad brain, somethin' like The Wiz
But, you see, the sad thing fuckin' with her is
Is the chick ain't even have brains, dummy like a bitch
So I tried to show her about the world
And about just who we really are
And where we've come and how we still have to go really far
Like, "Baby, look at how we live broke on the boulevard"
But all she ever want me to do is unhook her bra
Then all I really want is for her to go down low
Before you know it, she wet enough to get drowned slow
And all that deep shit I was previously down fo'
Replaced by freak shit I am currently down fo'
You see I peeped it, pussy is power
That proud feelin' we get knowin' that pussy is ours
And how it feels to feel that feelin'
You feelin' when you be drillin' that shit
Got her sayin' you be killin' that shit
And all the pain the world cause, she be healin' that shit
And naw, that ain't your girl, dog
But you be feelin' that chick
And you just wanna tell her everything she might need
But in the meantime it's lights, please
[Chorus]
Lights please, lights please, turn off the lights
For now, everything just seems so right
And how you make the darkness seem so bright
I'm feeling like things gon' be alright
Lights please, lights please, turn off the lights
For now, everything just seems so right
And how you make the darkness seem so bright
I'm feeling like things gon' be alright

[Verse 2]
So now we in the hotel, mirrors on the ceilin'
She say she wanna blow L's, I hear her and I'm willin'
But every time I smoke, well, a nigga mind gone
So that every word I spoke, well, I'm tryna put her on
But she couldn't hear me
I told her all about how we been livin' a lie
And that they love to see us all go to prison or die
Like, "Baby, look at how they show us on the TV screen"
But all she ever want me to do is unzip her jeans
Then all I really want is for her to get on top
Before you know it, she workin', jerkin' it nonstop
And all that next shit I was previously talkin'
Is now that wet shit that I'm currently lost in
And while that sweat drip, I am reminded
All the times my brother told me that pussy is blindin'
I'm findin', the more I grow
The more y'all seem to stay the same
Don't even know the rules, but yet y'all tryna play the game
And ain't it shameful how niggas blame hoes for givin' birth
To a baby that took two to make?
Coward nigga, you a fake
How you gonna look in your son's face and turn your back
Then go start another family?
Dawg, what type of shit is that?
She said it's okay, rub my head and told me to relax
Laid a nigga down proper, like she was recordin' tracks
Said "I know you wanna change the world
But for the night, please
Just reach over and hit the lights please"
[Chorus]
Lights please, lights please, turn off the lights
For now, everything just seems so right
And how you make the darkness seem so bright
I'm feeling like things gon' be alright
Lights please, lights please, turn off the lights
For now, everything just seems so right
And how you make the darkness seem so bright
I'm feeling like things gon' be alright
Lights please, ah-ah-ah
Lights please, ah-ah-ah
Lights please, ah-ah-ah
Lights please, turn off the lights
Lights, please

Alright, if y'all niggas heard the first one, The Come Up and shit, then you would have heard part 1 of this joint right here. It's "Dead Presidents", you know classic nigga, that's classic Jay shit. So I did it, threw it on the first mixtape, this is about a year ago. We let niggas hear like you know the mixtape whatever, and there was always this one nigga that stuck out to me like a year ago. This nigga's like "yo". like I thought I did my thing on this shit, that was like two of my favorite verses that I did, but he was just like "Yo", like, "Yo you didn't come right man. If you gon' come on Dead Presidents son, you gotta come, hard son, you gotta come harder than that son, you gotta come harder than that." I was like, man what you mean I came hard? But, that shit always stuck in my mind, so doing this next, you know, doing this The Warm Up I was like, damn, I gotta get on it again, I gotta do it again.

These niggas is playing
Russian Roulette with a full clip, foolish
My crew is foolless, no, we don't dance
All we do is stay two steps ahead
Make the hoes get loose like a noose neck
Instead while these dudes beg for head
They got the game twisted, heavy traffic in this rap shit
Look how my lane shifted, elevated my game, lifted my name
Now these lame niggas could never get it
Like that bad bitch you wanted but could never hit it
Clever with it, my flow like a devil spit it and heaven sent it
So high, if I dropped I would fall for 11 minutes
So yeah, I operate on a higher plane, my thoughts take a higher train
It's dope, then you should know the suppliers name
It's J. Cole, set of horns and a halo
And all these Jose Canseco's wanna text us like Waco
Its hard to remain faithful niggas be throwing hate
Yo I'm in a league of my own so what the fuck would I play for?
Some next niggas almost slid in but didn't fit in
Naw I ain't Maury Povich but who the fuck is you kiddin?
These big wig niggas throwing their bid in
Try not to show stress, I guess the flow is protested like a sit in
I told my niggas we would get in
But that ain't even half the battle
Stay behind like a shadow or you catapult
Now if I had a ladder or now even if I had a rope
I'd climb that motherfucker to the top and never let it go!

Heaven or hell, you choose, freedom or jail, you lose
I can't stop, I'm as hot as the devils shoes
Overcame a low life status to blow like Gladys
Ahead of my time like I live my whole life backwards
I'm nothing like these ho-like rappers
My whole life practice to be the one
What's it like to be LeBron
They calling you the saviour, so much pressure but you deal with it
The weight of the world on your shoulders but you still lift it
Ill with it for real, lil nigga from Ville that real niggas can feel
Nobody taught us how to cook still niggas a grill
No Foreman, try not to call them ladies bees but them hoes swarmin
Now honey, aye is it destiny or is it money you're feelin
Heard rumors of a deal and now you thinkin a million
Pardon my paranoid mind but I'm starin in the mirror livin in fear that things a never be the same
No one left for me to blame but myself 'cause I asked for this
Headed for fame but in my brain, hey can I last in this?
Aye five years I'll probably laugh at this
Try not to let it wear me out like a bad bitch with fashion sense
I keep it fresh while these wack niggas rehash and shit
Jackin styles you know, ski mask and shit
I pass these niggas, they tryna do it how these other niggas did it
I'm tryna live it how no other nigga ever lived it

I woke up early in the morning, hoes blowing up my phone
I ain't used to small talking when they know I'm tryna bone
Fuck 'em, I'll holla later, man, right now, my mind's elsewhere
My mom's healthcare, get her out this hell here
A lot of niggas fail, frail niggas won't prevail here
We seen it all man, niggas can't even spell scared
A Fresh Prince, but yo my city ain't no Bel-Air
Fuck if you would sell, I'm worry bout my welfares
So farewell to them broke days and bonjour to the most paid
Soon as my dough straight, I throw the wifey in some Dolce
And put some chains on my niggas like I own slaves
I get up, look out the window, hope the sun shining
Down on my niggas out there front lining
I hit the streets and see them boys out there locking up some older head
So Goddamn homie, hold your head, and hold your head
[Hook]
I get up, I see the clouds from my window
I pray the sun gon' shine this way
And where I go as the wind blow
Momma, your son gon' find his way
And if I gotta crawl, I'ma make to the end though
And to the top I'ma climb my way
And tell 'em I'ma rise, I'm on my—headed for the sky
I'm on my way

[Verse 2]
Paint a picture to show the deaf what it's like to listen
And speak the words and tell a blind man what he missin'
For all my niggas doin' time man up in prison
Felt you had to resort to crime, man fuck the system
We raisin' babies up in Hades where there ain't no hope
Ain't no fathers, don't take no scholarship to slang no dope
Politicians hollerin' bout problems but I ain't gon' vote
He talk about change, still we floatin' in the same ol' boat
So tell me how I'm supposed to feel when the President spoke
When he ain't never had to struggle, ain't never been broke
Ain't even roll through the ghetto ain't neva been close
Trustin' this government's like trustin' the devil in oath
For rebel with quotes, I get up
Lifestyle of the young, black and reckless
A generation of niggas strapped and askin' questions like:
"Tell me why I ain't got shit?"
I let this liquor fill my liver with them toxics as I sip

I get up, I see the clouds from my window
I pray the sun gon' shine this way
And where I go as the wind blow

And to the top I'ma climb my way
And tell 'em I'ma rise, I'm on my—headed for the sky

Yeah, to all my niggas paper chasin', I pray for your patience
Just keep the faith that you gon' make it one day you'll be cakin'
Takin this shit one step at a time, that real shit is stuck on my mind
But to that bullshit I'm deaf and I'm blind
Destined to shine I'ma find a way, 'cause hey
Damn it, them jobs out there ain't tryna pay, I pray
Granted nine to five is how you survive
I ain't tryna survive, I'm tryna throw my Momma in rides
I'mma provide for my seed I'm the soil
I'll teach 'em bout' loyalty
I'll teach 'em that his skin black like oil that's for royalty
I'll show 'em all the things that my pops was never showin' me
Treat 'em like a growin' tree with this poetry
I get up and show the sons how to lead not to follow
The present is our gift but our seed's got tomorrow
So please niggas raise your kids
And help em' overcome that bull shit they daze us with

Puffing on the city where the Lakers from: L-A, L-A, la la
So high, everything is a “ha ha” for me
Dreaming of the days of a drop 500
And a bad bitch that'll go to Popeyes for me
You can never tell me that I'm not hungry
If you ever felt what's inside my tummy
My mind wondering now, is my time running out?
Is the Lord up top with a stop watch for me?
Hope not, hope not, hope not, hope not

A wise nigga told me don’t chase that cash
Follow your heart, you’ll make that fast
Does a stripper love to shake that ass
Or does she wish to erase that past?
Got a nigga in her face, just gassed
Like “Baby girl, why you take this path?”
Stack in his hand, trynna make that last
All she thinking bout is how to take his last
Rub titties in his face and laugh
Gotta try not to look fake, in fact
A little more money, like a few more 20’s
When you let that nigga grab your naked ass
Okay, he’s gone now, roll her eyes when he whispers in her ear
“This ain't the life for you, baby, let me take you out of here 'cause..."

Only getting high 'cause we closer to hell
Niggas tryna live like Hova, but well
We broke and that dough coming slow as a snail
Hustle hard in the snow, in the hail
Hit the block like a postman with mail
My brother got knocked now they hold him in cells
My mom broke, but she posted the bail
Someway, somehow
Nigga feeling like the sun down even when the sun up
Hear the sound out the window of the gun bust
And you wonder why niggas keep the gun tucked
But this how niggas was brung up
A mother just trying to raise her son up
'Til a stray bullet got his lungs struck
And the Governor couldn’t give one fuck
While she singing

See, in my mind, it's like I'm perfect for her, I gotta show her
But sadly, in reality, dog, I don't even know her
But still somehow she got my mind infatuated
Absolutely fascinated
With the thoughts of what she might be like
Time after time after time I had to wait and
Is fate procrastinatin'?
I can take it 'cause I might be right, 'cause it's…

Besides, when I'm with her, this gon' be the spot we lay at
And maybe I'll just drive by occassionally

Except I don't like rap
Besides, if I went with you, then I don't really think my man would like that." (Damn, Damn)

Know exactly where he stayin'
Find out when he leave for work

Maybe even off the bridge

Then console her while she cryin'

So that must mean you want a nigga to eat that seafood
Baby don't be foolish but call her I'll watch her do it

Yeah, aye wassup man? Aye, uh, aye look man, can I- can I get on- can I just get on this bus? All I got is a dollar fifty, I'm just sayin'. I just tryna get- I'm tryna get on the bus, man. I ain't got no mon- all I got is a dollar fifty, I don't go two dollars. Man, fuck you and yo' bus, nigga!
(Yeah)
Hey, hey (Yeah, got a dollar and a dream)
Yeah, yeah
I got a dollar and a dream (Yeah), yeah
I got a dollar and a dream, real niggas on my team (Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Everything ain't what it seems
I got a dollar and a dream, hey (Hey, I'm dreamin')

[Verse 1]
Ayy, ayy, I got a dollar and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems (Uh)
Niggas hating but I love them even though they trying to scheme
But I'm past that (Past that), a nigga's stock is rising like the Nasdaq (Uh-huh)
They say I’m the future but yet I’m giving niggas flashbacks
Of better days when you ain't have to settle for whatever played
I represent the struggle, nigga, I say what they never say
Whenever they spit that bullshit they spittin'
This that pulpit, I’m hittin' niggas with the gospel (And the lord said)
Hostile with them hoes, I got a dollar in my pocket plus a dream
Yeah you laughing my nigga but everything ain't what it seems
What it means to know your mama or your father on that pipe
On that hard white, I’ll tell you what them scars like
I’m speaking through these bars like a nigga in the jail
Tired of siftin' through my mail, I feel like Cartwright, bills (Bills and bills and bills)
For real, a nigga ill
Just let me do the talkin', man, I know how niggas feel
[Chorus]
I got a dollar and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems
(God damn, nigga. These motherfuckin' bill collectors, man)
I got a dollar and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems
(Can't even God damn turn on my phone without these nigga ringin' me up)
I got a dollar and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems
(They tryna call me from different numbers and shit. Tryna- tryna fool me, nigga. I'm Lil Cole, nigga!)
Yeah, got a dollar and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems, yeah

[Verse 2]
I got a dolla and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seem
Every lady ain't no ho and every bitch ain't no queen
Every nigga ain't no dog and every nigga ain't no king (Uh-huh)
Shit be happening for a reason, everything is everything
Every nigga can't dunk, some white man can jump (Haha)
They shootin' niggas 'fore they even tell 'em put their hands up
Crooked cops got a nigga scared to drive
Probably thinkin' that I’m slangin', man, I see it in their eyes
But inside of my pocket is a dollar, plus a dream
Yeah, you swear your girl is faithful; everything ain't what it seems
See, I seen how she glance and looked away like she want it
I ain't sayin' I'ma fuck her, but I could if I wanted
Know it hurts that she flirt with a nigga, this is worse
I bet if I was to hit, man I wouldn’t be the first (Nah)
This is church, this is gospel (And the lord said)
Spit it like I get it from the Bible for your survival
[Hook]
I got a dollar and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems (Yeah, ayy, yeah-yeah-yeah)
Ayy, I got a dollar and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems (Uh-uh, uh, uh)
Ayy, I got a dollar and a dream, real niggas on my team (Wait 'til I get my money ri- hehehehe)
Everything ain't what it seem
Yeah, I got a dollar and a dream, yeah, I got a dollar and a dream

[Verse 3]
Check it
Aye Sallie, I know I ain't been answerin' your calls (Aww, not this bitch, yeah)
But shit, let me explain- (I can explain, I can explain)
It's because times been hard
Been runnin' 'round tryna find a job (I can't get no job)
I hear my phone ringing in the morning, 9 o’clock
And it's you (God damn), can't even front, I press ignore (Yeah)
I still got your letters layin' in my dresser drawer (Haha)
You tellin' me about all the things you did for me (I know, I know, I know, I know)
When I was broke, you sent me dough and that was big for me (I know, I know, big for me)
See you was there every year when I needed you
And you were so quick to give I had to be with you
Remember when I used to call you on your phone line
I knew it was official when my mama cosigned (Haha, yeah)
But in no time, a nigga graduated
I hit the real world, baby girl, I'm sad to say it
But I was usin' you, you gave a nigga major stacks (Major stacks)
And I know in my heart one day that I'm gon' pay you back
I got a dollar and a dream
[Outro]
I'll pay you back. Look, can we- can we set up some type of payment plan or somethin'? Like, you know what I'm sayin'? Like, you know? I just graduated six months ago so you know, times is kinda- times is kinda hard, baby. I- I just- can I just pay you like a lil' bit right now and then I pay you- I pay you the rest next- next month when I get paid. Can I just do somethin' like that? I gotta- I'm not even gon' lie to you, I don't, I don't really have it right now. I gotta pay how much? Five thousand dol- Aw, nigga is you crazy?

I bet they never seen him comin'
Like a blind bitch you fuckin' from behind
It's the motherfuckin' dime, bitch I'm fucking up rewind buttons
My shit is jumping like Lebron
Fayettenam on my back like some scratches from your lady
On your mattress where they gave me that
I bet niggas can't wait to pay me back
While they relax, I stay in tip-top shape
And I stay up on my toes like some gym socks, flip-flops
Tell them hater to rehab, kick rocks
Game tight like Ziploc
Half-Black, other half white like Kid Rock
Try to tell it to a cizz-op
Thought it would work, it did not
He told me "Nigga stizz-op, you know you is not"
Wrote the ticket and rizz-ocked
Fuck, this is for hip-hop, gassed up like a quick stop
They lit a fire under my ass nigga my shit hot
Even if you squatted over volcanoes, niggas your shit not
I'm raw, but I kid not
Your shit flop, I give props to the legends
Praise God but I give not to the reverends
Lookin' up to the heavens like
"Where did all my blessings go?" You chase a dream
But then you stop, guess you'll never know
I got a show for you to watch, here's an episode, professional
Set to blow any minute now, many women smile
Look the lights and the action, and the cameras be callin'
You niggas got to log in, bitch, you fantasy ballin'
I snuck up like I planned to be, this ain’t random, we called it
Like once they get a hit of this, they hooked like that Twitter shit
Thought I get a deal and head straight to the dealership
But looking at my deal I probably can't afford benefits
Medical, dental shit, left but I always came
Back like a rent-a-whip, dirty ass game
Dog, I could run a kennel with all these bitch niggas
Who don't lift a finger yet they wanna ride in the limo with
Me, I switch the tempo on them sort of like Timbo on em'
Start talking that "we" shit, I pause Nintendo on 'em (hahaha!)
Start talking that beef shit, I turn to kimbo on em'
I got no words for these niggas I'm instrumental on em'
Yeah! And I'll still keep goin', keep flowin'

Bigga then a nigga hittin' the gym

Ten steps up from y'all, you could follow my lead
If you shoot for the stars, I guess you aimin' at me
But please hold your applause
Y'all holdin' up the wall goddammit I'm on the flo'
Good Lord, can't you see me gettin' down on a ho
And she drop it so low she sittin down on the flo'
I never pound with the flo', at times I wonder
Aye when they listen to my shit man can they hear my hunger?
Or will these hatin' ass rappers try to steal my thunder
Aye this is big shit poppin', you gon' need a plunger
To take me under, niggas in trouble
You lookin' at LeBron James of the game
I could do anything that you name
I could blaze any rapper in the game that you bring
Pour gasoline on the brain, got the flame for that
So you hatin' niggas refrain from that
A little bitter 'cause yo game is whack
I'll let Elite breathe, yeah
I'll let Elite breathe, yeah

Aye you ain't gotta cry, don't worry 'bout me

A dollar and a dream, that's all a nigga got
So, if it's 'bout that C.R.E.A.M, then I'm all up in the spot
I'm just warmin' up, I'm hot but nah, I ain't flashin'
I never gave a fuck about no high-end fashion
And maybe I was too broke, maybe I'm just too dope
To rap about that regular shit, or bag a regular bitch
These niggas talkin' like they on the next level and shit
But Cole's flow so cold, Bet the devil get sick
How do you want it? So sick I make you mentally vomit
These rappers askin' for beats and they ain't even fit to be on it
I see 'em writin' about rappers, I should be sick to my stomach
Because they talk 'bout the future but didn't mention me on it
So now I'm back in the kitchen, cookin' I'm meant to be one of the greatest
No niggas seein' me, this century us and you hate it
Look how I played it, other niggas was jaded
Under-appreciated, now Carolina is rated

[Verse 1: J Cole]
I wake up, hop out the shower spray cologne on while I'm dressing
They hollering 'bout recession so my niggas out here stressing
But bitch, I'm live and breathing so to me that there's a blessing
See life is like a test that I ain't never got no F in
Stepping out today, I gotta leave the crib, Momma stressing out, I pray
That ain't nobody gon' pull the weapon out and spray
'Cause I don't got no strap
And ever since we hit depression, niggas don't know how to act
In fact, there goes some niggas there, hating, I feel the stare
Me verse you shining, that's like a diamond and silverware
Let y'all feel the glare I gotta go now
I'm riding through the city with the windows rolled down
Shorty hollered, so I pulled up beside her, I'm fronting, “What's your name?”
She told me, “Boy, you know me, don't play no games
Now, look, they say you're blowing up, hey, is it true, fired up?”
I say, “Girl, they wasn't kidding like they tubes tied up"
[Chorus]
I'm hollering hey
Good God, what a day
I gotta say it feels good to get away
Where ain't nobody stressing over shit they got to pay
Ay tell me what's work without play
All my niggas hollering hey
Good God, what a day
Hey baby girl, tell me can you get away?
Where ain't nobody hollering 'bout the problems of the world
It's just me and my favorite girl
Now all around they holler

[Verse 2: J Cole]
Okay so word been spreading
That I done jetted to New York, I was up there doing my thing
So now some folks I used to know is hollering out “J. Cole!”
I got to chuckle 'cause I know they used to say Jermaine, so who changed?
What's in name though, when niggas can't hang on your shoestrings?
The flow insane plus I got that flamethrow, that Liu Kang
Even in the winter we bring feelings of summer Suzanne
We get them hooked like T-Pain, and scoop them hoes like loose change
Can you blame me? I'm just a boy straight out the Ville
These wangsta-ass niggas getting played out for real
You acting like you trill, nigga you bet' not!
You talking out your ass, you finna get your head rocked
This is where they shooting sideways, boys getting blazed
Can't afford to fly so we get high to get away
Now come here ladies, see we tryna get you loose, pour it up
Take this juice, we gon' mix it with this Goose, don't throw it up

I'm hollering hey
Good God, what a day
I gotta say it feels good to get away
Where ain't nobody stressing over shit they got to pay
Ay tell me what's work without play

Sometimes play the villain, sometimes play the hero
Sometimes I be Dilla, sometimes I be Preemo
Sometimes I be feeling, I got a big ego
Other times a nigga swim around like Nemo
Uh, small fish in a big ass pond
Pushed around like a mower on a big ass lawn
I get my weight up, inflate up
And make these old niggas open the gate up
At the mansions that they laid up in
Like, "Hello my name is Cole" - I'm walking right up in and well known
Don't give a fuck it you gon hate it man, hey fellow
Either you follow me or swallow me bitch
And I done hit to many hoes to ever pause that shit
Now since I just seen my face up in the XXL
A few chicks want to text "let's chill"-how obvious
Girls from all over the world is my hobby
And I got a chick who stay in DC like a lobbyist
My old chick from Raleigh that I still like to parley with
Just to hear that accent, now come and get that back bent
The moans turn to screams, I can feel her climaxing
Now if you faking that baby you need to try acting
Hollywood shit, had a nigga feeling like the milkman
Deliver that through the body good dick
Feeling like I got game that Karate couldn't kick
Therefore I'm bagging things that you probably wouldn't get, what up
I'm a talk until you tell me shut up
Uh, and we can walk the beach until the sun up
Huh, I ain't gon lie I'm trynna get some cut up

Wanna cop the latest 'fore them other hoes find it

Probably 'cause she so fine it'll blow your mind
She black and Pocahontas, laid back and blow that chronic
Ass so fat, wanna tat my logo on it
So any other nigga that a tap will know it's mine
I put in work overtime
Let me cut, mow the lawn, guarantee I blow your mind
She tried to play me 'til she learned I wrote a rhyme
"That's that nigga from the Ville that I heard that Hova signed
The rap form Lebron, oh girl, that boy the bomb
No chain around his neck, but better watch out for the charm"
You're not my daughter, um, but you can be my baby

If you sleep I get you up, ride over and pick you up
If it's clean I'll lick you up, yeah, do you research
I'll rock that ass to sleep and have you sleeping in my t-shirt
Just came home from getting my South Beach on
You know I ran the streets like a dog without a leash on
She tryna get her freak on, come hop up on this ski jet
You scared of that water or you just scared to get your weave wet?
Barely got your feet wet, yes, I know where we headed
Tryna see you throw it back, let's check your reflexes
Good Lord, didn't know what I was in for
You could be my cuddy buddy, baby, what are friends for?

Ay nigga I'm better than the rest you just rest, boy please

So a nigga on a quest, no question
So I tell em birds no nesting
Laying in my bed, hope to lay a niggas egg
No, you'll never hatch mines
Baby, you don't match mines
I'm trynna shine like the bat sign, when it's crime
And the gats flyin up in Gotham, watch em
Far from a thug but I'll drop one
Far from a scrub but I'll mop em
Watch 'em better leave 'em alone like Stockton, when he retired
Shit, your shit is fire, boy stop
I don't buy it, boycott, stop lying
Ya shit is not hot man if niggas not buying
It's not rocket science
But the way I rock it help me build up my alliance
These niggas ain't playing in New York like the Giants, ha
A little line to show love to the city that got no love
Don't want to see a nigga grow rather see a nigga hold up
That's cold-blooded, well never to fail
If you can make it here, you can make it from heaven or hell

I seen a baby cry then seconds later she laughs
The beauty of life, the pain never lasts
The rain always pass, the sun don’t always shine (Yeah)
When it's gone I'm lonely, but when it's there I'm fine
I hate the wintertime because the nights come quicker
The light make them whites think I'm a nice young nigga
But at night they think twice and walk a little faster
It's funny, hunnid-years-ago I'd've called this nigga, master
How the tables turn but still the fire burning huh
I feel the heat the world is a dryer turning, turning
Im looking for some higher learning, learning
Girl you what I desire, yearning, yearning
You say I'm easily distracted
I think the problem is I'm easily attracted by the darkside
The temptation got me questioning where my heart lies
I'm tryna separate myself like apartheid
But ay the liquor keep swallowing
I swear I walk with God but the devil keep following
I say the devil keep following, following
I say the devil keep following, following
I say the devil keep following, following
[Verse 2: Omen]
Uh
Feel like I'm riding on a chartered plane of broken-hearted pain
Turbulence is constant my pilot has gone insane
If I can find a parachute to parasail
Maybe these parasites of paranoia won't prevail
Character dope as hell, but where is my parallel sweetheart
Deep thoughts lost in my brain so I sleep hard
Nights with no progress
Mane I'm thinking like I'll probably find a Loch Ness
In the projects before I find this
Object of my love, this object of my heart
Guitar strings have strum in search of my counterpart
Bound to start drinking or smoking, sink in this ocean
Leaping through the badness hoping I'm reaching for closeness

[Verse 1]
If my heart stop pumping tomorrow don’t feel no sorrow
'Cause life is hard mentally and everything is meant to be
Sometimes I ask myself, if I was gone who will remember me?
It's hard to tell, oh well, sit back and sip this Hennessy
Now lately it's been hard to tell my friends part from my enemies
'Cause plenty niggas show me love but in their hearts they envy me
Why? I'm just a nigga from around the way
Told my momma I'll make it happen and I found a way
Pour out some liquor for my niggas at the crossroads
And may the Lord give guidance to the lost souls
I know that deep inside these niggas know it's more to life
Then mackin' hoes and stacking dough
Man I'm sort of like a nigga who done seen greener grass
So when they think they ballin' like The Dream Team
My nigga I done seen meaner cash
And I'm tryna get it, follow me nigga, I'm on a prowl
Headed to the top, you watching me nigga?
Then hold it down
[Chorus]
Hold it down, if you need to holla at me
Don’t hesitate to call, it ain't a problem
I can be there, I’d ride for you, lie for you
I know you’d do the same, I would die for you
So hold it down, and when the times is hard, I’ll be around
So hold me down, and it don’t matter how far, I’ll be around
Yeah, I'll hold you down

[Verse 2]
You was my nigga from the younger days, we grew up
I went to school, you went the other way
But still my brother man, I'm sitting, reminiscing on
All of them bitches we were tripping over, kissing on
Or at the skating rink we trying to bag some new hoes
And If I need gear, you let me hold ya new clothes, and vice-a-versa man
But now that life is worser man, a nigga slow caking
I'm broke tryna chase a dream, you just got probation and I'm stressed
Your little sister pregnant what’s next?
Oh shit my mama doing drugs, at times it's hard to feel blessed
In this madness I holla at my nigga in the sadness
Remember when ya mama tried to beat you with that bat shit?
Remember your chick Nina? Man that ass was the fattest
Remember my crush on Sabrina? Yo, she still the baddest
I'm just glad that I can holla at you, it's been a while
And til the next time I hear from you, ay, hold it down
[Chorus]
Hold it down, if you need to holla at me
Don’t hesitate to call, it ain't a problem
I can be there, I’d ride for you, lie for you
I know you’d do the same, I would die for you
So hold it down, and when the times is hard, I’ll be around
So hold me down, and it don’t matter how far, I’ll be around
Yeah, I'll hold you down

[Verse 3]
And these are tough times baby, but we’ll make it through
You know I'm headed for the top, I swear I'm taking you
Just hold a nigga down through this bad weather
The rain falling ain't balling but I have better
A woman with an ass and a strong mind, it's been a long time
Sometimes you on your bullshit, sometimes I'm on mine
Will I have a hard time to stay committed?
Or do I only want your voice moaning when I hit it?
Man only God knows
I know deep in your heart, you don’t want me to be no star though
'Cause groupies out there every show you scared I'm fucking every ho
And girl I ain't gon' lie and say I won't, 'cause shit you never know
But may the Lord give me strength, I love you more than anything
The future mother of my kids, the love is real and if we ever part, God forbid
I love you still so when I'm on the road don’t trip, you know I'm down for you
Keep it tight and don’t slip, and hold it down for me
[Chorus]
Hold it down, if you need to holla at me
Don’t hesitate to call, it ain't a problem
I can be there, I’d ride for you, lie for you
I know you’d do the same, I would die for you
So hold it down, and when the times is hard, I’ll be around

Look all he wanted was a deal so when he got it he just faded
But tell me what's a deal when you want to be the greatest?
So Jay I appreciate it, hell of a stepping stone
Wonder if he see it in my eyes I'm trying to get the throne
Wonder if the people know how many nights I spent alone
Making beats writing rhymes, thinking deep fighting time
I'm getting better but wasn't getting younger
And all that time can make the most confident nigga wonder
But never doubt it or allowed that shit to phase me yo
Just switch my thoughts up like the stations on the radio nigga now I am

[Chorus]
And they ask and they ask and they ask and I tell them
It's the Fayettenam
Put your glasses and your glasses and your glasses to the sky
This is the last call for alcohol
This is the warm-up!
So get your back up off the wall
[Verse 2]
Now may I never slip up or let my grip up
I know my girl be praying Lord just keep his pants zipped up -
Now if some groupie bitch is on his dick then make it's stiff up, at least give the nigga common sense to wrap his dick up
Toast, let’s lift up our glasses, then sip up
We fly past they look up
They don't last they give up
They don't blast we clip up then empty
And indeed we hit the target yes these niggas think they the shit and they ain't even farted yet
Style incomplete like a garbage ass quarterback
My offense is for real, ay fuck sack, niggas getting coffined in the Ville
Way too often and it feels wrong
New York niggas fuck with me, I got 'em singing Ville songs
Guess it's only right because we grew up singing they shit
Big shit, Mase shit, Nas shit, Jay shit
Time for a Carolina nigga to take his place with the greats
A slim nigga making bold statement
Uh, ay J. Cole how you do that there? I hear you blowing up my nigga
I'm like, true that yea
In NY but smile every time I flew back there
That Carolina, Fayettenam oh yea my crew back there
I go home been so long they saying, you back here? -
Took a turn for the worst boy don't move back here
Don't do that, yo who dat?
He rep the Ville when he spit it told you he be back with a record deal and he did it
Nigga, fuck spinning on my pivot homie, I'm finna travel till 'refs blow the whistle on me
I got a whole fucking city that's just sitting on me
But it fits on my back, my state is sitting on that
Will I drop? I think not I get up while they stop-like a sleeve on tank tops
They ain't give it all they got so they flop
So hey watch, how I'm finna take their spot
Now I'm starting and they not-let me show you how to stay hot
I play not, man I'm killing em even your idols feeling em dog
The same nigga used to chill in the mall
While they were still in the mall, I was up there spilling my rap
The hero fighting villains just to put the Ville on the map
[Chorus]
And they ask and they ask and they ask and I tell them
It's the Fayettenam
Put your glasses and your glasses and your glasses to the sky
This is the last call for alcohol
This is the warm-up!
So get your back up off the wall

[Outro]
Yeah man so shit, this was The Warm Up
Um, what can I say, what can I say?
If you heard The Come Up that was about just a lil nigga from North Carolina man
Fayettnam to be exact
Moved to NYC, chasing the dream
I used college, if y'all niggas don't know, I used college as a tool to get to New York
I ain't have no family up here or nothing like that, I came up here on a scholarship, nigga went to college
And the whole time I ain't even think I would have to finish college, I just thought I'd be signed by my freshman year so I wouldn't have to finish college
But it didn't happen like that obviously, a nigga graduated and things started falling into place
I got more focused, I dropped The Come Up
And I look at The Come Up like, how kinda like how I was in high school
Just picture this, The Warm Up is about a nigga who did not make the team when he tried out and I know it's a lotta niggas who know that feeling man
You try out, you think you deserve to be one the team and you go that day to look at the cut-list
You wake up and you can't even sleep, you're like, "Damn I'm gon' make the team, I did my thing at tryouts."
You go to the list. All the niggas is looking at their names on the list, some niggas is like, "Aww shit I see my name nigga I'm good, I'm good nigga I'm good, I see my name."
And you're looking for your name, and you kinda play in the back, tryna wait for niggas to clear out cause you're not sure
And you go to the list and your name ain't there
And you're like, "How the fuck did I not make this team? I'm better than him, I'm better than him, I'm better than him."
So a lotta niggas either quit or some niggas go harder and so that's kinda how I took the rap shit when I put out The Come Up
Cause ever since I was 15 I thought I was supposed to be signed
But you know, shit, everything happens for a reason
So shit fast forward to The Warm Up, this just me, like you know, me being that nigga that's practicing and making sure it's no way, it's undeniable that when I go to tryouts, there's no fucking way the coach is passing up on me, my nigga
So that's what this whole mixtape was about and lo and behold, you know
As I'm finishing the mixtape, the deal comes
Thank God, I'm blessed. Everything happens for a reason. And it couldn't have been with a more fucking, with a better fucking squad
You know the niggas I got on the squad if you listen to this then you might have heard who I signed with, I ain't even gon' blast it off like that
Shoutouts to, you know, Mark Pitts, definitely
Shoutout to my nigga Mike Rooney, my nigga E, shoutout to my whole fucking crew, man
That's The Warm Up is about man
RG what's good, Mike Shaw, my nigga Mez, Mez held me down, nigga
More than anybody in the whole fucking, in the whole crew, honestly
So shit, let's get it, man
We got a lotta shit for '09, '010, '011, '0 goddamn 35
That's all I got man, that's The Warm Up
I made the team
So when you go from making the team, now what you gotta do nigga, you gotta start
You gotta be a starter, you gotta make it to college
You gotta make it from college to the league, nigga
Trust me, I ain't get no deal and fucking relax man
I feel like I ain't made it yet period nigga
And that's all I really gotta say yo, it's The Warm Up
Thank you for listening man
Yeah17Embed Losing My Balance Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, ugh, yeah
1-2, 1-2, 1-2, ugh
1-2, 1-2, 1-2, ugh
Yeah, ugh
Yeah, ugh

[Verse 1]
Miss High Profile, caught you shoppin' on Canal (Yeah)
I guess it makes sense, it seems phony as your style
Your hair and your nails just as phony as your smile
Fake eyelashes, you drew your eyebrows
It make a brother ask, do you pride yourself?
Your makeup like a mask, tryna hide yourself
It seems on the outside, you thinking you the shit (Uh-huh)
But there's a soul that's inside that you don't even knew exist
So you so out of touch that the world mistreat you
Rich niggas fuck you and broke niggas beat you
Hope that this will reach you when you understand
That your value ain't determined by another man
'Cause right now you let them brothers get the upper hand
And you just tell 'em "Go deep" like Cunningham
And you just let 'em OD like Len Bias
And that pussy so good he let his friends try it
[Chorus]
Losing your balance, yea uh
Losing your balance, yea uh
Losing your balance
Girl you losing your balance uh, yea
Don't slip and don't fall, uh
Just a get a grip my nigga, hold on, uh
Don't lose your balance (Yeah, ugh)
Don't lose your balance (Ugh)

[Verse 2]
I look around at my city, this is Sinville
That boy 11 years old and can inhale
Sometimes I ride around wonderin' if we in hell
Or why do cops love to throw a nigga in jail
I'm 'bout to lose it, I just had another friend killed (Damn)
Over some bullshit this cycle's like a windmill
I had a convo with my soul, I asked it "When will
This shit change?" It said, "Boy, just use them pen skills"
And so I write this for my niggas on the corner
Love you 'cause you my brother, so I feel I got to warn ya
This shit ain't set up for a young brother to advance
On that note, you niggas playing right into their hands
Damn, better get yourself some goals (Uh-huh), you niggas better dream (Yeah)
I know the hood raised you but it's bigger better things
And for those that passed, I need a moment of silence
Sssssshhhhh
[Chorus]
Yeah, and don't be losing your balance
Don't be losing your balance
Don't be losing your balance
My nigga, don't be losing your balance, uh, yeah
So don't slip and don't fall
Just a get a grip my nigga, hold on (Yeah)
Don't lose your balance (Ugh)
Don't lose your balance (Yeah)

[Verse 3]
Ugh, I got a thing for this little mama
She do it to me plus her brain is forreal, I'm a
Sucka for love I guess, won't catch her up in the club 'cause she ain't into that (Nah)
Kind of chick that rather rent a flick and get intimate
Say she never fuck with thug niggas only gentlemen
And yea that ass is fat but what's better is her intellect (Uh-huh)
Other men would sweat her when we walk past
Can't even blame 'em, did the same when I saw the ass
Matched with the thin waist, brown with a slim face
Love the conversation and the kicks was like a sensei
Now she got me chillin' with her all around the clock
My homies beefin' 'cause I never come around a lot
Keep on telling me I changed and things ain't the same
And ever since she came around I never want to hang (Ugh)
They tell me that it's foul how a chick can make me switch
But man I can't help it dawg, her mind got me whipped
[Chorus]
I think I'm losing my balance, uh
I think I'm losing my balance, yea
She got me losing my balance, uh
She got me losing my balance, yea
But I, I won't slip, nah, I won't fall, ugh
Just a get a grip and hold on, ugh
Losing my balance (Uh-huh)
