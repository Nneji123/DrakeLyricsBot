Intro Lyrics[Intro]
Know I'm sayin'?
This that new wave shit, know what I'm sayin'? (Ya dig)
Man, this that new wave shit, ya dig? (4 Pockets Full)
Know what I'm sayin'? Watch them eat this one up (know what I'm saying?)
Okay
Free the gang

[Verse]
I'm smoking loud this that moonrock
They tryna sue me cause I'm gettin' paper
I dropped out of school didn't get no education
My momma, she happy 'cause I finally made it
She living better, her house big as fuck
Buy her a Bentayga Bentley truck
With a AP today, tomorrow switch it up
Honeycomb diamonds VVS's cuttin'
Standing on stage, I really came from nothing
I took me a break, don't mean I'm getting rusty
I'm gaining this weight they say I'm getting husky
I stand on front line I'm all about the fuckery
I go where I want, nobody better not fuck with me
Extended the glizzy shoot it 'til it's empty
I come from the projects jumping over fences
I found me a plug and went and made a killing
I think we in love we should just have some children
Them narcs I been sipping got to have me trippin'
I didn’t come to play I had to reinvent me
I handled my business now I'm worth some millions
Remember the safe deposit box was empty
Them niggas weren't fucking with me they weren't friendly
If you weren't with me then, you ain't seeing him with me
We like Kanye and K, you like Bobby and Whitney
Real dope boy I ain't nothing' like the weirdos
Never seen me putting on the weird clothes
It cost a lil' more when it's real gold
We already up keep the field goal
Remember that day that I had lost all that cake
I had to go in the safe
I had to get me a pot and cook that shit up
Had 'em calling me Quay
I had got that shit back in like twenty-some-days
Ain’t no chump change, I’m talkin' bout' 500k
I went straight to the lot and went bought me a wraith
Ain't no more being humble put it in they face
I won't feed in the drama I'm loving the hate
But one thing for sure, Lil Baby go crazy2Embed Spazz Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, Southside
I go nuts on Southside Beats
Baby, okay

[Verse]
Super Bowl ring, we ballin' hard, we won the championship
Everybody got somethin' to say when I ain't even ask 'em shit
Bunny rabbit blow, take a brick and do a magic trick
A hundred racks a show, get on the stage and do a backward flip (Yeah)
I'm in L.A. with some real Crips
I want Stella McCartney, this real drip
Cartier on my face with the wood tip
Put the knife on the K, it's the real deal
Make 'em get out this bitch like a fire drill
If I won't hit a bitch then the guys will
I've been on it, today I took five pills
I'ma run up them M's 'cause it's God's will
How you gon' check me?
She like my gangsta, she wanna arrest me
She wanna sex me (Yeah)
I had to block her, she know not to text me
Comin' at you niggas 3D
They gon' put this shit on repeat
Everything I say, they repeat
Any nigga try to sneak diss
I ain't gon' say nothin' back, yeah
I'ma keep gettin' these racks, yeah
When you speak 'bout me, speak facts, yeah
Got an FN on the kickback, yeah
Big nose, hood on the demon
Big to the streets, I'm a deacon
They wouldn't even peep what I was preachin'
They just wanna see me with the leaches
Big ballers, I ain't in the bleachers
Courtside, high five the ref
Codeine got me talkin' to myself
Blowin' up, I'm blowin' out my belt
Richest top 5, nah, for real
Under 25 before the deal
Every time we slide, a nigga kill
I just hope the guys get they appeal
[Outro]
G5 sittin' in the cell
He 'bout to come (Came home)
I got this money on me right now
I don't even answer my phone (Put 'em on)
I had these bitches in state to state
They tryna give me some play (Leave me alone)
They know that I ain't got time to waste
I'm tryna get in their face (I'm goin' home)
I might just give you a couple of dollars
And make sure you good on a model (Good)
They know they'll probably gon' see me again
Unless I'm in that new Benz
I put the Forgiatos on the car
Mickey Thompsons on the truck
I got the money, I'm runnin' it up
And I've been puttin' it up (Them M's)2Embed I’m Straight Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah
Cook that shit up, Quay
I look up, I see I got bout seven rides in the streets
Know what I'm saying?
Living life to the fullest, you know what I'm saying?

[Chorus]
Ain't got no regrets, I can't complain my life is great (I'm straight)
I just woke up today made a hundred thousand dollar play
I sold a hundred bags before an hour hit
So many blue hundreds they stickin' like they counterfeit, I print this shit
Whole lot of ones, I'm in the cut, I'm going dumb-dumb
I'm sippin' act', and that some real deal, do you want some?
Same ones tryin' run with the clique
Be the same ones that throwing salt on the clique
Main reason why I'm fuckin' ya bitch, I ain't gon' say shit
[Verse 1]
I asked you about it, you lied
You asked me about it, I kept it one hundred, I'm nothin' like these other guys
I really spent two thousand on kicks and only wear 'em one time
Something about a nigga mind frame
Diamonds doing jumpin'-jacks in the AP, I can make the time change
Two hundred hoes in my call log and I ain't got not a name saved
Took her out the hood, put her on the drip, now I got her rockin' name brand
Me and Ced had two different spots, we usually around the corner doin' the same thing
Everywhere I go my chains hang, free the bros out the chain gang
New Maybach cost 230, I don't even get my shoes dirty
I don't even sleep when I get tired, you can see the Adderall in my eyes
Tiger said he got the drop on the opps
Fuck it slide and shoot up the block
Niggas know how we come through
G5 out the sunroof

[Chorus]
Ain't got no regrets, I can't complain my life is great (I'm straight)
I just woke up today made a hundred thousand dollar play
I sold a hundred bags before an hour hit
So many blue hundreds they stickin' like they counterfeit, I print this shit
Whole lot of ones, I'm in the cut, I'm going dumb-dumb
I'm sippin' act', and that some real deal, do you want some?
Same ones tryin' run with the clique
Be the same ones that throwing salt on the clique
Main reason why I'm fuckin' ya bitch, I ain't gon' say shit
[Verse 2]
We use trap out my mom house, turn the condo to a hideout
We can't be fuckin' at my house, niggas be runnin' they damn mouth
Walk down on them broad daylight, it ain't no fun in no drive-by
I'm cool on the love and the high-fives
You niggas can't keep up with my guys
You can't get all this drip in a lifetime
I got out and ran it up at the right time
We got Dracos whenever it's nighttime
We ain't ever gonna stop at the stop sign
Went to Wafi, I told 'em I want to shine
Then the coupe quarter million, they wiped me down
I'm running this town, everything I say facts niggas can't take that
New Lamborghini 18'
Only thing I do is make cream, I don't why these niggas hating
Only thing I do is drink lean, rest in peace to Fredo Santana
I just keep on buying all these Fantas
I don't want to go out like that, only thing I know is get racks

[Chorus]
Ain't got no regrets, I can't complain my life is great (I'm straight)
I just woke up today made a hundred thousand dollar play
I sold a hundred bags before an hour hit
So many blue hundreds they stickin' like they counterfeit, I print this shit
Whole lot of ones, I'm in the cut, I'm going dumb-dumb
I'm sippin' act', and that some real deal, do you want some?

They catchin' cases, it's all gon' half from a twinner, midget

Last whip, I wrecked it and I left it
Fuck it, I'm still livin' reckless
Told my lil' bitch that she selfish

Yeah
Wheezy outta here

[Verse 1: Drake]
The dash, it's digi', the schedule busy
My head in a hoodie, my shorty a goodie
My cousins are crazy, my cousins like Boogie
Life is amazin', it is what it should be
Been here for ten but I feel like a rookie
I tell her, "Look up" 'cause it's snowin' in Tootsie's
Booked for three years, man, you can't even book me
It's me and Lil Baby, this shit goin' crazy
Wheezy produced it and Weezy F. made me
And she held it down, so she got a Mercedes
Young Money Records, the Army, the Navy
They ran me ten thousand, I threw it like Brady
The foreign is yellow like Tracee and K.D
I trusted my niggas, they never betrayed me
Met all these niggas, they sweeter than Sadie
When I started out, I just took what they gave me
Did all the favors, they never repaid me
It worked in my favor, 'cause nobody saved me
[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Brand new whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch, please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave
Got M's in the bank, like, "Yes, indeed"

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Cartier glasses, I won't even peek at you
Yellow Ferrari like Pikachu
I got 'em waitin' and watchin' what he gon' do
Tryna peep what I do, tryna steal my moves
25 hundred for a new pair of tennis shoes
The same price, I could make them youngins come and finish you
Lawyer been chargin', he a Jewish like he voodoo
Real dope boy, hundred thousand in Evisu
Presidential tints slide by, we don't see you
I been gettin' money, I ain't worried 'bout what he do
I'm gettin' money like I'm from the '80s
Me and Drake 'bout to drop, man, this shit gon' go crazy
They know I'm the truth, comin' straight from the basement
I'm straight as the street, man I come from the pavement
A million, all hundreds, it make 'em go crazy
Wah-wah-wah, bitch, I'm the baby

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Brand new whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch, please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave

Heard you been doing business with the opps, fuck you and all them niggas
We gon' keep riding around with them Glocks until we find them niggas
[Verse 1]
They thinkin' I lost it, remind them niggas
I can get flyer than niggas
Hundred thousand in a Gucci bookbag, they thinkin' I signed a nigga
I leveled my life up, this Rollie I got on don't tick tock
Still on that bullshit, if you pull up on me, let the stick talk
I'm in L.A. with the vibes, they in the cut getting high
She tryna get in my ride, she tryna turn up tonight, yeah
I was running up cash, yeah, I had ran up a bag
And they started gettin' mad, yeah
But I didn't get mad, I just kept getting cash, yeah
Now I'm in my bag, yeah, now I'm in my bag, yeah
She wanna get with me, she know that I'm sticky, but I'm in my bag now
She wasn't fucking with me, she didn't come around, she wishing she had now
And I'm in my bag now
I'm in the bag, the Goyard to be exact
Three hundred racks inside it, and that ain't no cap
I could've bought a Wraith today, yeah yeah
I ran it up, they supposed to hate

Water drippin' on me like I'm a faucet
The crew with me right now

And she tryna leave me, but I ain't gon' let her
Diamonds on Fiji, I'm running with QC
And Reebok endorse me, went up a new level
I'm loving this lifestyle and niggas wanna be me
I know they won't catch up, but I ain't gon' let 'em
As soon as the money get up to a million, put it in the ground and then go buy a new shovel
How you gon' be in yo feelings when I'm in my feelings?
We both can't be in our feelings
I ain't gon' lie when you thinkin' I did it, I did it
It's something 'bout your intuition
Ain't telling you no lies, I'm tired of seeing you cry
Come here girl, let me wipe your eye
Everything gon' be alright, yeah

Running through hundreds and millions a day
They know not to play
Yeah I’m the one you can see on my face
A mil in my safe
Everywhere I go I’m keepin' a K

Cartier glasses they sit on my face
I ain’t throwin' shade
I’m getting money, I ain’t in the way
[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
We just been balling like Odell
I got your hoe on my coattail
She in her feeling but oh well
We got em packs from wholesale
Running through thots in the hotel
Give 'em couple of hundreds for toe nails
Only time I'm in crowed, they both tell
They can say it was vacuum sealed with no smell
I was sitting in jail with no bail
I was sitting in prison getting no mail
My nigga switching up on me I don’t care
They got jack shit on him he won't tell
ZO6 Vette, ridin' the fast lane, hope I don't wreck
I'm on that red
Pourin it up with most disrespect
Forgiato on my cars now
I been fuckin 'round with the stars now
5 stars for my lineup
Give these niggas a chance but they time us
Switch the hustle, I did get the grind up
In the spot hundred dollars the lineup
I'm the big homie niggas can line us
Stickin dick in this bitch cause she fine as fuck

[Chorus: Lil Baby]

Free my dogs out of prison I miss you

Showing love it could all be so simple

[Chorus]
Yeah, Fifty-five hunnit for a new pair of titties, I'll buy 'em like Jordans
Give her a couple of thousand, now she feelin' important

Pop a Addy, we'll be fuckin' all night
She say she got a man but it's alright, shoot outta town, first class flight

Ain't got no time I'm always on tour
I press decline I always ignore
I had to tease her so she can want more
Baby we grown we can fuck on the floor
Condo top floor, we gon' make love on the balcony
She want that dick tryna tackle me
I'm gettin' money like I was a athlete
Wake her up and put her back to sleep
I let the homie hit after me
She got super head he enjoying that
I ain't cuffing no bitch I ain't doing that
Once I hit it one time I ain't goin' back
I'm out the door like a floor mat
She say she diggin' my format
I'm the baby I'm a rug rat
She like, "Damn baby where my hug at?" I'm like, "Damn, baby, we don't do that"
Gave her a couple of thousand for the pussy
Get in there let her know I ain't no rookie
Put on a show like somebody else lookin'

Top floor penthouse suite, baby, we high up
Who said that you cannot buy love?
We gon' be making love until the morning, baby, I'm tellin' you, this is your warning
I'm not gon' stop it, I'ma keep on flowin'

Baby you was lucky that I choose you
Fuck all that talkin', baby, I'ma show you

I know I be drippin' from my toe up
Just don't tell 'em nothing that I told you

I can't wait around for nobody, I need it right now
I might buy that car if it make the right sound
Solitaire earrings bling blingin' from a mile away
I can't do what she want me to do, she tryna take my child away
I think my past tryna haunt me (Haunt me)
What do everybody want from me?
What do everybody want from me?
What do everybody want from me? (From me)
I gotta give it to 'em, if I don't
I might go to the hood, I'll make a song
Turn the trap spot to the studio
[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
I'm tryna make a way for my folks
Seein' how I'm Oakland City only hope
I gotta get it, I ain't got time to play
Ain't got no time to waste
I've been havin' nightmares about goin' back to jail, so I wake up
Drankin' all this lean, poppin' Adderall so I can stay up
Niggas that I used to love actin' like they're mad 'cause I got my cake up
Ain't gon' never let it get to a nigga, keep on grindin', tryna get another million
Condo on Peachtree, I paid the rent for the closet
They just wanna talk about my past, they don't wanna accept the fact that I'm a boss
Everything I wanted, I'ma go and get it, I ain't trippin' 'bout a cost, yeah
Everybody want a piece of the winnings, they're never there when you're lost
Seen my main man try to cross me, I'm tryna pass it down to my offspring
All these hoes see me flossing, seen my first mil', felt awesome
They can't follow me, I lost 'em
Had to boss up, so I bossed up
Now I'm bossed up

I can't wait around for nobody, I need it right now
I might buy that car if it make the right sound

She gotta be piped up to feel my emphasis
She hot, yeah, she sizzlin'
But can't love her more than a studio
Serena and Venus, yeah most of my chains tennis
So I wore it all to the studio (Studio)
My baby mama got pregnant, had to buy a bitch a car to get an abortion
She just wanna see tears and sad faces on my shorty
But I can't get mad, that's the way it go when you're fortunate
Leave a million cash in the street, nigga better not touch it (On God)
Act like they came to lay hands so their trust don't get busted (No cap)
Straight from Mossberg to Hillsborough
Birds, bless the J's on that cizzurb
Ridin' in the Lambo that the lil' kids say "Bingo" to
My last two years were the worst ones in my career, but I'm still rich as you
Disneyland's where your kids go, on a private jet when I'm into you (When I'm into you)
Them lil' bitches that be hatin' need to pipe down (Pipe down)

[Chorus]
I'm only getting in where I fit in
This is a two-seater you cannot sit in
I got a dub in the rear end
I got caught when I fucked her friend
Say I wouldn't do it and did it again
I got some dogs who want me to win
Went to the lot and bought a new Benz
I hit the gas I'm gone with the wind
I'm only getting in where I fit in
This is a two-seater you cannot sit in
I got a dub in the rear end

I had a carbon I was fifteen
We tryna steal and rob everything
I can't even talk about what I seen
I'm never telling the laws a thing
Made it out alive, can't even lie that shit was awesome nigga
Shootouts I ain't had no bullets I had to call some niggas
Lost lil Juan in the middle of the summer, that shit was awful nigga
As soon as we found out some witness who tell us who did it, we gon' off them nigga
Had to cut off a couple niggas I thought was with me, tried to cross a nigga
These niggas think they can just come and kick shit in my city, it's gon' cost them niggas
Jumped in the game and went got me some millions, no cap
I made a wave for us
Them bitches weren't fucking with me when I didn't have no money, now they can't wait to fuck
Every one of my lil buddies mama know we thuggin', that's why they pray for us
I was in the back of the Bach like Rosa Parks
Me and my dogs on Tec, a four or more
Grind every day like it ain't no tomorrow
I was just broke, ain't going back
I'ma run mines up to the max
I want the cheese, ain't fuckin' with rats
I wanna fuck her I give her a rack
If she don't give me head ain't texting her back
I'm a dog I go deep in the cat
Remember one time I ain't have jack
I had a hunnid I bought me a pack
I took the pack and went got me a bag
It started rolling and coming in fast
I had the old heads hanging back
Now I'm rich now and that's why they mad

Ooh, the ice on my neck got me frost
Mama ain't made no hoe, she made a boss
My diamonds they shine when the lights turned off
Rocking designer I'm dripping in sauce
All of my diamonds real so they cost
You know it costs to live like this

Too many diamonds, camera glitch

Ice cold like I got on mitts
Ice cream I look like a lick

Running money up I don't see nobody
Buying lawyers for bro 'cause them folks got 'em
Tennis chains on fleek, I could wear a new piece every week
Me and my diamonds all on pee, point
Ask about me, I dug deep for 'em
Hit the bitch Curry, three-point
I can't hit them all so I Pikachu

Yeah I'm shining, I'm frostbit
Ain't got to tell them they know that I'm rich
I got a sack like I run the blitz
Ice cold like I got on mitts
Ice cream I look like a lick
[Verse 2: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Forty pointers that's a waffle cone
Ice cubes on my neck like my styrofoam
Drip, dripping like they left the shower on
Them ain't real, them diamonds are rhinestones
I'm straight I got the iron now
Too many hoes bought another phone
I apologize, AP honeycomb
Shorty walking round with like three hunnid on
Baby vanilla, my rose gold match the Gucci with rose petal
Trapper of the year I need a gold medal
You know the water make the pussy get wetter
Ooh, can't name a nigga that do it better
I got too many hoes like I'm Hugh Hefner
Different foreign bitches, I'ma put 'em together
Yeah they know I'm a trendsetter

[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
I got too many hoes I can't fuck 'em all
Don't know how to play but I ball
Stacking that money up make it tall
Ooh, the ice on my neck got me frost
Mama ain't made no hoe, she made a boss
My diamonds they shine when the lights turned off
Rocking designer I'm dripping in sauce
All of my diamonds real so they cost
You know it costs to live like this
I got a bad lil boss bitch
Too many diamonds, camera glitch
Yeah I'm shining, I'm frostbit
Ain't got to tell them they know that I'm rich
I got a sack like I run the blitz
Ice cold like I got on mitts
Ice cream I look like a lick6Embed Never Needed No Help Lyrics[Intro]

It can get ugly (Huh)
Would you leave or stay like you love me?
From the bottom, all I know is the struggle
Can't get no job, so all I know is the hustle

[Verse 1]
Yeah, bankroll gettin' bigger (Nigga)
Empire gettin' built up, givin' racks to the right nigga
I can get a pack overnight, ain't nothin' like you niggas
Sippin' syrup 'til my body numb, I ain't tryna catch no feelings
I ain't never bite no nigga
She give me brain now 'cause I'm famous
I got these chains on, gettin' tangled
I'm in the big Benz, not a Wrangler
It's still a Jeep though, it ain't cheap, ho
I'm just happy they gon' free Rico
Dodgin' stank hoes and R.I.C.O.
On a Sprinter van with them Dracos
Probably ridin' around with Starlito
I'ma bust it down with my lil' bros
Buy cars for all of my kinfolk
If the sack ever did get low
God knows it's gon' be a robbery
Why the fuck everybody callin' me?
Everybody who left took a part of me
Excuse my drip, yeah, pardon me
Show me a list of who hard as me
[Chorus]
It can get ugly (Huh)
Would you leave or stay like you love me?
From the bottom, all I know is the struggle
Can't get no job, so all I know is the hustle

[Verse 2]
Right back after tour, ain't got time for no attitude
Why I cannot lose, feel like I had to do it
I'm in my savage mood, put a lil' back into it
Treat me with gratitude, I ain't no average dude
Need my rims offset like Cardi B
This might be my hardest beat
Put the blame on Pee, he started me
Got the game from Big, he guarded me
Coach threw me in, took me out the streets
Now I get racks to rap on beats
I still know plugs with packs for cheap
Killers owe favors, they'll whack for free
Never did fraud, I got cash receipts
Lotta niggas get they swag from me
Don't tell nobody 'bout bags from me
You were not in the street, you wouldn't last a week
My bitch so bad, I pass on freaks
I'm here 'cause my granny be prayin' for me
None of these niggas ain't playin' with me
Got hitters that'll sit in that can for me, yeah

It can get ugly (Huh)
Would you leave or stay like you love me?

We don't sell shit, we just make hits, yeah

Keepin' my composure, never sober
Never chokin', always smokin doja
Fuck 'em if they gettin' over
Got a Moncler coat because the kid the coldest
I ain't changed, I stayed the same and maintained
It's safe to say the kid gettin' older
Forever gang, I'm never switchin' over
Made a lane and niggas can't get over
I can't match with rappers, they be bogus
Really get a pack and keep the over
Big dripper, stand up in the ocean
Everybody trappin', we get loads in
He ain't 4PF if he ain't got motion
Made a half a ticket off promotion
Shout out Swishers Sweet, they keep me rollin'
But if we catch the opp, we gotta smoke him
Ridin' 'round with Dracs like we OVO
I got some racks and I want some more
Still got them passin' the hood, call it give-and-go
Keep a nigga main bitch in a figure-four
Let me fuck when I want, I just come and go
Man, these racks gettin' too big for these skinny clothes
I might put me an M in some big Girbaud
Let lil' bro hit the stick, had start gettin' old
I spent five hundred racks on a Lambo'
And didn't even know how to make that motherfucker go
On my birthday, I just wanna lift the door
Barely flex, but don't play with me, period
Shooters follow behind in a Urus
In the Rolls truck, I feel like a tourist
I'm the one from the bottom who sold all my partners them pounds
Used to drive in a Buick
[Chorus: Lil Baby & Gunna]
Hot, hot, hot, I'm heatin' up
I fuck with slimes and I'm gonna bust (Bah, bah)
He can't put on that drip, he ain't one of us

How you got everybody lit, pipin' up?
Oh, she bad with no swag, I can pipe her up

Count the money up fast like I'm typin' somethin'

Keep the Rugers, my niggas ain't scared of nothin' (Nah)
And ain't no rules, you got racks, you can get it done (Yeah)
On a light day, I keep me a honey bun (One hundred)
Makin' hit after hit, call me Barry Bonds (Hits)
For this Christmas, I bought everybody guns (Swear)
Glocks and choppers and FN's for everyone (Grrat)
Take that roof off the car, let her feel the sun (Wow)
My bro go see his barber five times a month (Yeah)
Got this bitch out the college, she suckin' and swallow (Uh)
I stick it in, she feel it in her gut (In her gut)
We don't run from our problems, we stackin' up guala and guala I'm tryna get that mega bucks (Racks)
We them drippers, lil' nigga, best watch your step (Them drippers)
This top shelf, got forty designer belts (Drip)

Think I'm deaf, got stones in my right and left (Ice)
How you crank up the car? Ain't no key in there
Just pull up, spin they block, and get out of there (Get out of there)
Wake up, have a hard time findin' what to wear
Treat these hoes like a tire, I keep a spare
Want a strap because I'm war ready (War)
Check the trust account, it's more fetti (Yeah)

Hundred-fifty plain Richard Millie (No cap)

[Verse 1]
Runnin' up this money been a breeze (Phew)
Flew her in, she fuck me ’til she leave (Uh)
She done fell in love, I'm sellin' dreams
I done fell in love with buyin’ jeans (Jeans)
Hate I found a love for sippin' lean
Hellcat faster than a Demon, new G-Wagen with no key
Put baguettes in my AP, I ain't on playin' about they beef
Niggas know I play for keeps, treat my brothers like they me
Had to make myself a boss, it ain't no nigga workin' me
I invest a couple mil' and let my money work for me
Know they hate the way it happened, probably somewhere cursin' me
I don’t know nothing ’bout no killin', all I know is murder beats
I got rich and understand my next three cars gon’ be a lease
I ain't never losin' sleep about no beef, I roll in peace
I put diamonds in my teeth, came from grindin' in the streets
Get a load and break it down and sell it all and then repeat it
Pray to God for all the dawgs behind the wall, they need they freedom (Free y’all)
When I be on TV and perform, I hope they see me (See me)
Once it's up, it's stuck, we get over on niggas, not get even
Forgiato rims on my dually, I ride diesel
Only rock Amiris with my team, not no Diesel
Got some niggas up in Philly play with birds like they Eagles
She keep sayin' I'm the man, that shit boostin' up my ego
Still in Atlanta sellin' bags like they legal, I'm just sayin' (Yeah)
[Chorus]
How you try to run off with the wave and you ain't surfin'?
Gave 'em all the drip, them niggas still acted thirsty
I ain't even counted up to see what I'm worth yet
All I know is put it up and keep on workin'
I can't even hold you, I been gettin' loaded
Devil on my shoulders
God got my back, so I keep on rollin', yeah

Drop-top McLaren (Oh), everybody starin' (Lookin')
Lil' one from the hood turned into the man (Big dawg)
Get a lot of money (Yeah), try to stuff it in my pants (4 Pockets)
I might do the woah (Woah), nigga, I don't dance
Rings on my hand cost a fortune
Shout out to my mama, no abortion (What's up?)
D-Boy, white Air Forces (Crisp)
Different kinda bags, I got choices (Flavors)
And I got the swag for a loyal ticket
Think I'm hearin' voices in my head sayin', "Kill him" (Kill him)
Know she'll forgive me, I'm one of the real ones
Really from the trenches, turn a dollar to a nickel (Get 'em)
Baddest of the baddest, guess I gotta wait to pick 'em
Try us, then we smashin', then they go to playin' victim (Kill 'em)
I don't know what happened, all I know is he got hit up
I'ma need a napkin, chains drippin', VV's lit up
I'ma get the money and go hard long as I get up (Get up)
We gon' beat the trial, I told lil' bruh to do some sit-ups (Push-up)
Win, win, win, no lose or draw, I never give up (Nah)

Get popped, nigga, I ain't doin' no fightin'
Sinnin' 'bout cash, I ain't doin' no right

Car too fast, can't stop at no light
I hit the gas, it skrrt, then I pull off
I'm on they ass, I just took a year off
She shakin' her ass, call me when she get off
Took half a mil' for my lil' bro to get out
That new Richard Mille made me feel like a boss
Feel like I'm Meech when I'm ridin' in these cars
Who you know pull up whole entourage in a foreign?
I got designer for days, but it's somethin' about 'em
Go crazy for white Air Force 1's, maybe 'cause I'm a dope boy
He be loud, but he ain't makin' no noise
'Ventador on the ground like a skateboard
If I want it, I get it, I pay for it
I pay extra, I ain't tryna wait for it
Everything that I got, it was made for me
I was servin' them trap houses faithfully
Everybody with me gotta eat
Say your grace with me

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Thou shall not try one of us, if they do, I'ma bust
Please don't reach for no chain
Not 'bout the set, but it's more 'bout respect
If they get me upset, they gon' die, that's on gang
Ran up my check, when I walk in the bank
They greet me at the door by my government name
I made a promise, I'm never gon' change
Rolls-Royce umbrella, I'm hopin' it rain, yeah

Right back on it, designer my garments
Corner store mornings, there until the sun down
I don't trust no one, I can't put my gun down
Goin' number one now, hottest out, hands down
Bands out, pants down, yeah, I'm thuggin'
I done got rich, everybody my cousin
You ain't servin' no packs with me, you ain't my brother
That chopper go through shit, I call it the cutter
I just bought a new whip, I went bought another
My mother, she happy now
Ain't no cap and gown, but I graduated
Her house paid for, and that new Mercedes
Know you see that they been tryna be me lately
I'm a heavy hitter like Gervonta Davis
That shit ain't gon' save 'em, leave 'em on the pavement
All I know is get this motherfuckin' paper

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Thou shall not try one of us, if they do, I'ma bust
Please don't reach for no chain

Fucked a nigga's ho, so he say he wanna kill me

Damn near went deaf, when they told me they killed you
Turn rat? Nigga, fuck on

Still'll flood a nigga town with a truckload
Get the head, I'm out, I don't trust hoes

Body got picked up, doggy I'm hurt
Still pay the lawyer even though I'm nervous

Bend her over, then I murk her
Call Gunna if you want you a Birkin
"Oh, Baby, you be lyin' in your verses
I be hearin', say you buyin' 'em purses"
I can't even lie, you ain't my type
You ain't even all that fine in person
I can guarantee you if you my kind
She got every bag you can imagine
Big house, I can really be braggin'
Hundred thousand in my mouth like, "What's happenin'?"
Not the big cheap teeth, that's embarrasin'
He ain't me, you can keep the comparisons
My bitch probably one of the baddest
Good girl, turned her into a savage
Dispatch, got a problem in traffic
We came through in matching G-Wagens
Low-key, I've been keeping it classy
Could be really out here doin' 'em nasty
Niggas couldn't even see me in last year
Just started and them niggas in last gear
I ain't even try to and I passed 'em
Giving looks, I contribute to fashion
Drop a song, I be giving them captions
Stand alone, not your regular rapper

I put the dope in the back of the car and I tell 'em to go
She hit when she land, she bring me the bands, she back on the road
She know how I get when I get in that mode
Ain't fuckin' with bitches, ain't buying no clothes
Wanna do shows and make me some songs
Make sure that other shit come in, get sold
We fuck with the strippers 'cause we play with poles
We play with our money and not with our nose
I used to go to the West to get loads
I just came back from the West with a trophy
I'm on some more shit
She said she miss it and sendin' emojis
No time to kick it, I'm always in motion
Can't say I miss you, I don't got emotions
I'm on that back-when-I slept-on-the-floor shit
I'm on that me-and-the-bro-kick-a-door shit
I'm on that back-when-I-stood-at-the-stove shit
Ain't goin' broke, I'm just back on my old shit
I'm takin' drugs, I don't know how to cope it
I know one thing, I'm never gon' be hopeless

I got too many cars, I ain't payin' no note (Note)
Too many chains, go to sleep, I might choke (Choke)
I be sippin' on syrup, I ain't drivin' no boat (Boat)
We in the store, she don't know which one gold
This bitch think that she slick, but I'm buyin' 'em both
We on Rodeo, lil' bro got his heater

I know it's a blessing
Christian Dior and Jordan 11's ('Leven)
I just hope I can dunk into Heaven (Heaven)
I just fucked on an actress for breakfast, I hope she ain't messy
I just be fuckin' bitches, I don't be textin' 'em
It ain't no in the middle, shoot the messenger
He won't let nobody get the best of him
Oh, you don't know Scotty? Take a Tesla
Plus she won't let me get it in, so I left her there
I got too many women, Baby Hefner
I let the lil' bros keep the extra
I used the baking soda, we was stretchin' 'em
Making these deals, numbers come in decimals
Or I might get bored and buy a bitch a hair salon
I'ma pay for it, bruh, ain't never have to front
I make a million dollars every other month
As soon as I get done, I'ma give her some
Not like the rest of 'em, I'm a different one
I had to shoot back, I ain't get to run
Can't let a fuck nigga take my mama's son

I got too many cars, I ain't payin' no note (Note)
Too many chains, go to sleep, I might choke (Choke)
I be sippin' on syrup, I ain't drivin' no boat (Boat)
We in the store, she don't know which one gold
This bitch think that she slick, but I'm buyin' 'em both
We on Rodeo, lil' bro got his heater
I walk in Moncler and buy everyone coats
I can live off my closet before I go broke
I got too many cars, I ain't payin' no note (Note)
Too many chains, go to sleep, I might choke (Choke)
I be sippin' on syrup, I ain't drivin' no boat (Boat)
We in the store, she don't know which one gold
This bitch think that she slick, but I'm buyin' 'em both
We on Rodeo, lil' bro got his heater
I walk in Moncler and buy everyone coats

(Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up)

[Verse 1]
I been the type of guy she like since middle school
Never thought that I'd get famous, always know that I'd be cool
Could've been fucked on shawty, I just didn't wanna be rude
Eliantte diamonds, I want the finest for your jewels
And my hitter 'dem be slidin', don't put cameras on my crew
I ain't doin' too bad, I'm somebody, you can Google me
I ain't never worried 'bout what they say that they gon' to do me
I just put in overtime, I'm doin' numbers like it's two of me
That was back then, times change, this a newer me
Money conversations at the table, I speak fluently
Stay away from bad vibes, I can't see no nigga doing me
Still give a couple thousand, even though she would of did it free
They don't treat me like no rapper 'cause my vibe like I'm in the streets
I'm one of the top five, it ain't too many guys as real as me
I barely get sleep, I'm tryna make sure everybody eats
Took a trip to overseas, I'm buyin' drip in other currencies
I'm on fire right now, and it ain't somethin' that's just currently
And a bitch told a lie if she told you she was curvin' me
And we all big dawgs, ain't gon' let my people work for me
911, we got a problem, it's an emergency, yeah
[Chorus]
I heard that crime pays (Uh)
They think we thugs 'cause we got ice, I'm going plain jane
No matter what, at least a quarter for my main thing
Showed up on Forbes, I can't complain, I'm tryna maintain
Hop off a plane, pick up a check, then do the same thing
I heard that crime pays
They think we thugs 'cause we got ice, I'm going plain jane
No matter what, at least a quarter for my main thing
Showed up on Forbes, I can't complain, I'm tryna maintain
Hop off a plane, pick up a check, then do the same thing

[Verse 2]
Lately, I been diggin' your vibe
I can tell by the look in your eyes
That you need to get some shit off your mind
I give you my time, give you jets in the sky
Have you runnin' 'round in laps for me
I perform, when I'm done, you should clap for me
You got problems on your head, you can chat with me
Have you runnin' around the globe chasing racks with me
M's in plastic, sometimes I'm sarcastic
I just like to hear laughter, tryna ease all this pain
Took off fast, I know they hate how I passed 'em
Don't gotta be in the grave, they throwin' dirt on your name, yeah
[Chorus]
I heard that crime pays, uh
They think we thugs 'cause we got ice, I'm going plain jane
No matter what, at least a quarter for my main thing

A love letter came through the mail, it said, "I miss you"
I ripped it up and flushed with the tissue, try to forget you
I ain't got nothing against you, we human, we all got issues
But I'm tired of being tired of being tired
That part of me done died
I see it, then I don't, act like I'm blind
I'm confident it won't be one of mine
I know emotions come with lies, so I tell the truth all the time
Ain't got no sympathy for no bitch
I admit that I'm rich and I'm lit
Jumpin' up on stages, I get two hundred an occasion
Bro had really fucked the game up, we made niggas shut they trap down
They see how I made it, I'm the reason they won't rap now
See me out in traffic, make a hater pull his hat down
The biggest OG's salute me, a stylist can't even style me
The robbers probably wanna get me, I'm hoppin' out Lamborghinis
The youngins turn in my city, they try me, I get it cracking
Some of this still would happen if I never had started rapping
My people them still steady trapping and they still be getting active
I tell 'em to chill, I'm tryna run up these M's
Paid cash and then he post the crib (Nah)
I can't show nobody where my mama live, that's how I 'posed to feel
My niece just asked me were my diamonds real, I said, "Of course"
I just played the hand that I was dealt, didn't have to force
All around the world they know it's me, they hear my voice
And I done it all in a pair of Diors, yeah
[Chorus]
Young age, learned how to get paid (We gon' get the money)
Big stage, long way from Section 8 (Ballin' other countries)
Big wave, he gon' have to get saved (Big old wave)
Ridin' in the foreign, chiefin' on the forest
I know I wasn't there for you, at least I said I'm sorry
You know what it was, I told you that I was heartless
I'm emotionally scarred, that ain't even your fault
But don't listen to them haters tryna fill your ears with salt

[Verse 2]
All this revenue coming in, I'll probably never spend
I just bought my BM a Benz, now that's another Benz
I just cut off all of my friends and brought my brothers in
I don't see nobody but me, who I'm gon' lose to?
I can't move around without tools, these niggas loose screws
I can see me taking the lead over the new school
They remember me from selling weed at my old school
Only hit it once and now it's old news
Blew up, who the fuck would knew? Paint my Trackhawk Nipsey Blue
If I get one, you get one too, I really move how bosses move
I never call myself a G.O.A.T., I leave that up to the people
Everybody can't go to the top, I had to leave some people
I'ma be forever scheming, woke up, I thought I was dreaming
Watched my lil' boy play with toys, I just dropped a tear of joy
Some shit that I feel for
I been going crazy with that scoring, call me Baby Harden
They say I'll be great, I guess I'm waiting for it

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
I paid some extra before we even come out
And don't even wear it to show I ain't playin'
I hit the bitch and I gave her some racks
And I pull up my pants, she know I ain't stayin'
Go on a store run and get rubber bands
I done got rich, I done put on my mans
Choppers in traffic, that's just how I'm livin'
They say that I'm trippin', they wouldn't understand
She take a trip, she come back with a tan
I take a trip, I come back with them bands
When I was dealin', it really was killin' 'em
Had 'em competin', tryna see what I'm payin'
She throw a hoodie on soon as we land
She don't like pics, I got too many fans
I'm runnin' shit, I can do what I want
And it's really a limit, you do what you can
I found the booth and I put that shit up
'Fore I run out of cash, they gonna run out of land
I fell in love with this bitch 'cause her head was amazing
I swear I don't even know her name
I'm 'bout to takeoff, I gave 'em a chance
They gave me ten M&M's on advance
Thought I'd be trappin' forever, but God came and blessed me
I guess it was part of the plan
How he on fire, but he cool as a fan?
Can't get at you, we gon' get at your man
They can relate to me 'cause I be poppin' it
Put in they face, let 'em see what I'm sayin'
I'm rockin' shows like I play with a band
Free all the bros, know I would if I can
If I don't mean it, I swear I ain't sayin' it
'Fore I was 21, swear I was savage, smashin'
[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Hold up, who got Backwoods? I need roll up
Dior store can't keep up with me
I'm spendin' thousands like money is nothin' to me
I'm never comin' back, them people under me
Not the fans, yeah, the haters
Lotta bands on the table
They say I went commercial, I ain't know it
They want me catch a murder, I ain't goin' back
Play myself and my position, who doin' that?

[Verse 2: Lil Uzi Vert]
We got FN with extensions, we throwin' that
Her ass got my full attention, she throwin' that
Niggas talkin' way too much, I ain't goin' back
And forth with niggas 'cause these niggas be holdin' racks
On the real, yeah, we know you don't own them racks
Four pockets full, push 'em down, they start pokin' back
I turned eight million right until I'm a quarterback
Spent a million like I'm tryna bring Kobe back (24, woo)
I'm ready, I'm ready, I use the crockpot like it's Betty
They say the drop hot and it's ready
Might stretch it out, but it ain't fetti (Yes)
Say my dawg doin' time
But I know he ain't gonna snitch 'cause it's still some shit he didn't tell me
My dawg stabbed his celly
He told me the whole story over the celly (Brr, hello?)
Went up on my price, in my pocket like Kelly
Fucked her in the telly, no I can't not say who, no telly
My head gettin' heavy
And you know I still got Balmains on my ass (Woo)
No, I can't do no Amiris
Said I'm takin' trips, long flights, they scary
She said her birthday in March, okay, cool, so that means you an Aries
I told her, "Gotta go," she said, "You serious?"
Diamonds cold as December, my vibe Sagittarius
[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Hold up, who got Backwoods? I need roll up (Haha, period, period, slatt, woo)
Dior store can't keep up with me

They want me catch a murder, I ain't goin' back
Play myself and my position, who doin' that?

[Verse 3: Lil Baby]
I can switch up and come back another way
If the vibe ain't right, come back another day
Biggest dripper, I start up a tidal wave
Remix weed, we put it in a microwave
Batch for twenty-three like I know Michael J
He can say what he want, but he gotta pay
Used to hide all the guns where my mama stay
Sell my drugs 'round the corner
I pay all these bills, I'm a grownup
My cars a lil' different, I own 'em
I ain't with no leasin', my bitch tellin' me I need credit
It's loud and clear if I said it
I come from the gutter, I spent me a hundred on Chevys
You can take me out the hood, but you can't take the hood out of me
Know the hood proud of me
I Givenchyed my tee, went and upgrade my teeth
Yeah, I dropped out of school, but that paper on me
[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Hold up, who got Backwoods? I need roll up
Dior store can't keep up with me
I'm spendin' thousands like money is nothin' to me

She got Rollies on her timepiece when she step out, she be flashin'
Whenever we get alone, I give her half and she get nasty

And now everybody be tough, is he gangster or he just actin'?

Now I sell bags every day in my city
Ain't doin' no playin', when they come, be ready
I got murder on my mind like that lil' nigga Melly (Free Melly)
Big boy rocks, stud the same size as Nelly (Ten karats)
Long as I live, I'ma get this cheddar
Ever since the bitch left, doin' lil' better
Which car I'ma drive? It depends on the weather
Rolls Royce truck pull up like, "Hello"
Pretty, tall, light skin, shake like Jell-O
If the bitch actin' bougie, I'ma take her to the ghetto
If I ain't smokin' Runtz, then it's probably Limoncello
You got a lil' boy, but you not on my level
Sell P's every day in the hood on my schedule
Young nigga give a ho whole groove like Stella
Jam don't shake like that, that's Jell-O
Made a whole M on the road, then lay low
I'm a real boss in my hood, I got say-so
I was havin' choppas 'fore I heard about Dracos
Put me in the casket with a bust down halo, yeah

It's a cold world, so my house in Miami still came with a fireplace
Pupils dilate, don't judge me
I'm with a sex slave, she like rough D
I got a text straight from the plug, he said "There's a drought"

And only time that we act, is when we act asses

Clothes busted, nose dusty, watch the older bros hustlin'
Started off wrong, but you couldn't tell me I ain't know nothin'
All I ever want was to put on and give my folks somethin'
Knockin' on my sister window, comin' in at 4 somethin'
Mama trippin' 'bout the way I'm livin' and how my hoes comin' (In and out)
Caught the next-door neighbor slippin', we slimed him, left his nose runnin' (In his house)
Knowin' I can't lie, so when she asked me, I  make no comment
Terrorizin', thuggin', doin' dumb shit, makin' no money
It was time for me to go up, got a pack and made it blow up
Went into that corner store until I got it all
Know I skipped a couple parts, but I can't never tell 'em all
But the moral of the story, I got it all out the mud
The way karma make me feel, I swear I think I'm in love
Been fuckin' strippers since I was lil', fell in love with the club
Bruh gave me everything I need, knew what to say to the plug
I got my hands on a few mil', but shit, it still ain't enough
It's like my life is like a dream, but I'm still here when I wake
I'm gon' get everything I need, I'll do whatever it take
I caught a case, ran, got away, I should've jumped in the lake
I thought about it the other day when I slid through in the Wraith

Damn, my life's changed, check my ice game
Came from standin' in the rain to top floor gettin' brain

Bad bitch, we both young
They say that I'm cheatin' and we both dumb
But Baby got her wrist hittin', both arms
G-Wagen and Range Rover, both of 'em
If we love forever, you get new homes
I just wish that other **** could move on
She proud to be rockin' that new two-tone
My life goin' good, why would I do wrong?
I'm livin' my best just like Lil Duval
I didn't get the message, and it's screw y'all
I don't want no issues, can't be beefin' with my family
I don't want no problems, just make sure my kids can count and read
And it ain't no pressure 'bout the money, I won't even see it
It's bigger, it's the principle, I hope one day that you can see
We got a whole seed to raise, it's bigger than you and me
How I'm not gon' do that? I spend millions on my jewelry
The only reason I'm mentionin' it is 'cause I'm tired of this foolery
I'm just emptying my thoughts, I can't keep 'em in a box
Ain't no hard feelings at all, I want everyone to ball

Wake up every day, somebody harrassin' me
I got rich, they need money, they askin' me
I was sittin' in jail, they ain't look out for me
Ones who need me them same ones who doubted me

Head way down with me, know that she proud of me
Turn the heat up, ain't nobody hot as me
Everywhere dollars be, that's how I gotta be
I done gave her the world, now she not leavin'
Say she love me to death, told her, "Stop breathin'"
He try do what I do, but we not even
I want all of the beef, I am not vegan
Boy, you said it was smoke, nigga, stop speakin'
'Ventador, drop the top, I can't stop speedin'
Tryna see if this bitch hit the top speed
Hit the bitch from the back, have her knock knee
Call me Baby Hov, I control the rock
If the rap slow, I control the block
Yeah, I'm really it, and you niggas not
Got a couple coupes, I can drop the top
I done made it, nigga, all these digits comin' in
I'm savin' for the bigger picture, know one day I'll need 'em
Might as well get used to me
My biggest fear is endin' up a used-to-be, yeah

I know bitches tryna get to know a nigga 'cause his digit
You a Honda Civic whipper, in my (In what?) chameleon (Yeah)
We should start a group and we can call it New Edition
Maybe we can do it different, prolly make a hundred million (Yeah)
I come from a place between the bricks where it was hard at (Woo)
Whenever I ain't around they talkin' 'flauge, I had to fall back

Don't you call me with it (Don't you call me with it)
Boss nigga, we don't talk 'bout chickens (Brr, brr), nah-nah-nah-nah
My Rolls Royce in the projects, they look at me like I'm God
Don't ask me 'bout no such-and-such, don't speak about no charge
I just stack my money different, every ten go in a rubber band
Too much attention on these rappers, fuck it, we gon' whack their man
Some shit I don't understand, I go get it, I never ask
I don't condone that robbin', but if you slime, suggest you wear a mask
Treat my niggas and my bitches all like players, buy 'em all bags
Wish I would've answered for the homies that I can't call back

My dawg just lost his dawg into the system, it got me fucked up
I can't tell him nothin' negative, so I told him he gon' luck up
Had a bittersweet birthday, got a bad call in a Rolls truck (What?)
Red guts look watermelon and spaghetti and some ketchup (Hey)
All my niggas leavin' me, this shit got me depressed (Woah)
Thought he was gon' wreck the Maserati or the 'Vette
But he on the yard with the old dawgs, they at rec (Huh)
I missed a court call, what they said?
[Verse 3: Lil Baby]
No more fake text messages, leave 'em all on read (Yeah)
And this game some bullshit, but they payin' so I play it (I play it)
Cartier earrings, act like I don't hear what they be sayin' (Yeah)
Keep that shit too solid, I spent millions on my family (Woo)
None of that shit promised, I pay cash, I take chances (Woo)
I don't understand nothin', I don't want no advance

[Verse 1]
Seems like we runnin' outta time
Yeah, we still so young and got so much to find
We can't never let 'em break our mind
We gotta stay strong, conquer and don't divide
I come in peace, my heart already set on fire
If it ain't color, what's the difference from you and I?
I'll let you decide or come up with some repeated lies
I'm just tired of my kind gotta be the one to die
Lookin' in the sky, I know you with me, I can't cry
Standin' what I stand on, I can't never switch sides
Sometimes I just wanna pop out on 'em and flip by
But I put my head on, I pray, I stay from off the route
Thinkin' 'bout my niggas, I ain't seen 'em in a while
Thinkin' 'bout my son, I just had another child
I been thinkin' back on bro, like, "What the fuck we gon' do now?"
On this road to redemption, this shit get rocky and it's wild
Let me tell you 'bout it
[Chorus]
I'm so dumb that I was thinkin' that they could
When they really can't, yeah
I was thinkin' that they was, when they really ain't
It's my fault, I can't blame no one
If we take off now, we can catch the sun
Maybe watch it set, have sex, get some rest
I'm so dumb that I was thinkin' that they could
When they really can't, yeah
I was thinkin' that they was, when they really ain't
It's my fault, I can't blame no one
If we take off now, we can catch the sun
Maybe watch it set, have sex, get some rest

[Verse 2]
Know you be behind me if it ever came to this
But I never would've thought that we'll have to take this risk
Or ever be in this position, just keep ridin', don't go missing
If we in this together, this the way it 'posed to feel
I'm going out with a bang, I'm tellin' you what it is
If I get racial profiled where I live
'Cause my crib bigger than theirs, or my cars up to date
Or it's probably be my girl shape, they probably wanna date her
Or they heard I got my cake up, middle finger to them haters
My life finally matters, I got up and I'ma stay up
I know it lookin' like a dream, but it ain't everything it seem
Ain't no tellin' where I be if I ain't have God or ain't have my team
Can't let 'em trick me out the streets, I got a mind of my own
I left the house at sixteen, I told my Mama, "I'm grown"
Been through a lot of situations, I can handle my own
If I had only one call, I know you pick up the phone
If they ain't with us, we gone
[Chorus]
I'm so dumb that I was thinkin' that they could
When they really can't, yeah
I was thinkin' that they was, when they really ain't
It's my fault, I can't blame no one
If we take off now, we can catch the sun
Maybe watch it set, have sex, get some rest
I'm so dumb that I was thinkin' that they could

I'm too real, fuck is y'all mean?
I ain't have to sell you no dream
I said what it was, you didn't believe me
You be the cake and I be the cream
Now I look up and then she was leaving
I'm on the way, cannot be late
Speedin' through traffic like I'm in a race
I wanted it now, she want me to wait
I'm one of a kind, so you gotta taste it
Granddad died, knew I would make it
I'm a real one, you can't fake that
Most of my niggas still be takin'
I got rich, this shit still don't faze me
You only get one call, I can't chase 'em
Might take one shot, a lil' chaser
Stayin' up now for us to fuck later
Mama used to tell me times would get greater
Cartier diamonds blockin' these haters
Dior drip, shit gettin' tapered
I just spent a Bentley truck with lil' Tatum
Favor for favor, nigga, I don't pay them
Get off my dick, nigga, we don't play them, yeah
Look like it, we don't stay here
Makin' half a million dollar plays, juggs
Still chunkin' up neighborhoods
Grass cut, sure the neighbors good
My partner's mama know I'm really hustlin'
If the spot hot, we invade houses
We got kicked out, go in they house, yeah

It was hot and it was dark and I had thought of ending it all

Ain't stuntin' that ho, I can buy that look
Clothes off, how your body look?

Said that's your bro, y'all all get pushed
You was in the house on punishment

Give me style and credit for all his looks
Sold-out shows in the DMV
Now Shaquille O'Neal can't lil' boy me

Had some dirt off in my diamonds, had to brush it off

I invested in the West, their niggas know I've sold my dope there
Pretty pussy, no hair, she don't like when I put it in my song
So I can't go there, but she know I like to go there
[Chorus]
Nobody got hit, spin the block again (Yeah, yeah)
I done been too solid, something got to give (Yeah, yeah)
Rockin' real diamonds before I got the deal
Through the grace of God, we got away, so now we gotta chill
They thought it was rap cap and I told 'em that I got a mil'
You can get whatever if you ask me, you ain't gotta steal
My lil' woadie said he fightin' demons, feel like he gotta kill
And I just left the hood to catch a vibe and that shit give me chills

[Outro]
